This directory contains a test for using freestanding Ada code with Genode.

The program relies on the normal startup procedure of a Genode process.
Execution starts at the 'crt0' assembly entry provided by the startup library.
The 'crt0' code sets up the stack of the main thread and calls the '_main'
function implemented in the C++ portion of Genode's startup library. In turn,
the '_main' function calls 'main' of the actual program. The main function of
this example calls the Ada main procedure. The test further exercises the call
of C functions from Ada code. So the integration of Ada and C code is almost
seamless.

Please note that the current version of this program does not use 'gnatbind'.
Therefore, package elaboration is not executed.
