This directory contains an example Ada program on Genode.

An Ada program relies on the normal startup procedure of Genode
components, which calls 'Component::construct()' in _startup.cc_. It
enters the Ada code by calling the Ada main procedure '_ada_main()'
from 'Component::construct()'. Additionally, the test exercises calls
of C functions from Ada code to demonstrate the almost seamless
integration of Ada and C code and illustrates the implementation of
Ada libraries in Genode. Ada programs require the _ada_ library as it
provides the needed runtime.

Please note that the current version of this program does not use
'gnatbind'. Therefore, package elaboration is not executed.
