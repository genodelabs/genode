The fuse_fs server provides access to a FUSE based file system by using a
File_system_session.

The File_system_session component implementation is independent from each
FUSE based file system. fuse_fs only calls the FUSE operation in question
directly. These operations are provided by the FUSE file system and Genode's
libfuse library makes sure, that each operation is executeable, e.g. by using
a dummy function in case it is not provided by the FUSE file system.
Therefore, to utilize a FUSE file system, the FUSE file system is linked
against libfuse as well as the File_system_session component. For each
fuse_fs server there is a binary (.e.g. 'os/src/server/fuse_fs/ext2').

Note: write-support is supported but considered to be experimantal at this
point and for now using it is NOT recommended.


To use the ext2_fuse_fs server in noux the following config snippet may be
used:

!  <start name="ext2_fuse_fs">
!  	<resource name="RAM" quantum="8M"/>
!  	<provides> <service name="File_system"/> </provides>
!  	<config>
!  		<policy label_prefix="noux -> fuse" root="/" writeable="no" />
!  	</config>
!  </start>
