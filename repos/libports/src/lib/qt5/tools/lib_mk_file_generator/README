The scripts in this directory have been used to generate the
'lib/mk/qt5_*_generated.inc' files.

Usage:

- download and extract the Qt5 and qtwebkit source archives
- apply all qtbase/qtdeclarative/qttools/qtwebkit patches from the 'src/lib/qt5/patches' directory
- create a build directory next to the extracted Qt5 source directory
- copy the scripts into this build directory
- change into the build directory
- execute the 'create_generated_incs' script
- move the generated files into the 'lib/mk' directory

Notes:

- ICU (libicu-dev) must be installed on the host system to get the QtWebKit files generated
