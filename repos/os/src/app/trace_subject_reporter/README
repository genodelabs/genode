This component obtains the information about the existing trace subjects from
core's "TRACE" service and delivers a report to a "Report" server. The report,
in turn, can be used by top-like applications to present the consumed execution
time per thread.

Configuration
-------------

The interval of report generation can be defined via the 'period_ms' attribute
of the '<config>' node. The value is specified in milliseconds.

The level of detail of the generated reports can be influenced by the
'<report>' sub node of the configuration. The following example shows the
default values.

! <config period_ms="5000" >
!   <report activity="no" affinity="no"/>
! </config>

When setting 'activity' to "yes", the report contains an '<activity>' sub node
for each subject. The sub node has the two attributes 'total' and 'recent'. The
'recent' value represents the execution time consumed in the last period.

When setting 'affinity' to "yes", the report contains an '<affinity>' sub node
for each subject. The sub node shows the thread's physical CPU affinity,
expressed via the 'xpos' and 'ypos' attributes.
