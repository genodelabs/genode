This directory contains the implementation of Genode's platform driver.

Devices ROM
-----------

The platform driver knows which devices exist, as well as what resources
they need by parsing XML information from a devices ROM. This ROM might be
a boot module, written by a system integrator, or is dynamically produced
after investigating ACPI and PCI(*) information. The devices ROM name can be
defined by setting the "devices_rom" attribute in the config of the
platform driver:

! <config devices_rom="my_devices">
!   ...
! </config>

If the attribute isn't set, the platform driver asks for a ROM called
"devices" by default.

Behavior
--------

Per client a policy must be configured that states, which client can
access certain devices to form a virtual bus per client. The client may
iterate through the virtual bus using the devices_rom() function of
the platform_session interface to discover all available devices of the virtual
bus. When identified a specific device, its device capability can be obtained
via its unique name. Simple device drivers that drive exactly one device do
not need the devices ROM, but can simply obtain their device capability via
the acquire_single_device() function of the platform session interface.

With the device capability the resources of the devices can be obtained, e.g.
io_port, io_mem and irq of the platform_device interface.

Policy usage
------------

A policy may contain several nodes describing several devices.

!<start name="platform" managing_system="yes">
! <resource name="RAM" quantum="8M"/>
! ...
! <config>
!  <policy label_prefix="usb_host" info="yes">
!   <device name="ehci"/>
!   <device name="uhci"/>
!  </policy>
! </config>
! ...

The managing_system attribute is evaluated by init. If set to "yes", it
permits a component, the platform driver, to restrict the allocation of memory to
specific physical RAM ranges. The platform driver uses this feature to ensure that
the allocation of DMA capable memory consider several restrictions. For
example, some drivers, as the UHCI controller, requires a
physical memory address below 4G. Another example is: on 32bit hosts
physical to virtual identical mappings of DMA memory for the device PD
(required when IOMMU is used) must be below the kernel memory boundary (3G).
On some systems, e.g., base-hw kernel on certain ARM platforms, it allows the
platform driver to call system management firmware via kernel syscalls.

The 'info' attribute in a policy node describe, whether the client's devices
ROM will contain detailed information about physical resources of the devices
of its virtual bus. This is only useful, when using ported legacy drivers, which
operate with global names of physical resources.

Policy for PCI devices
----------------------

PCI devices are named according to their bus-device-function triple as
hexadecimal BB:DD.F (see example below). Thus, dedicated devices can easily
be selected by name in policies.

! <device name="00:03.0" type="pci"...>

Policies for PCI devices do not necessarily need to state the name of
the device, but can either state a class of devices, or a vendor/device
pair of identifiers inside a pci sub-node:

! <config>
! <policy label="usb_host -> ">
!   <pci class="USB"/>
! </policy>
! <policy label="nvme -> ">
!   <pci vendor_id="0x1987" device_id="0x5007"/>
! </policy>

The following class names are supported which correspond to the
specified PCI base class (B), sub class (S) and programming interface
(P) combinations. ('-' matches all devices in the category)

alias       B   S   P

AHCI       01  06   -
AUDIO      04  01   -
ETHERNET   02  00   -
HDAUDIO    04  03   -
ISABRIDGE  06  01   -
NVME       01  08  02
USB        0c  03  00 10 20 30
USB4       0c  03  40
VGA        03  00  00
WIFI       02  80   -

Report facilities
-----------------

The configuration of the platform driver supports different levels of reports.
By default the platform driver does not report anything. But when adding a
report node:

! <config>
!  <report devices="yes" config="yes"/>
!   ...
! </config>

it is possible to enable either a devices and/or config report. The first will
open up a Report session to dynamically report all accessible devices, and its
state. Whereby the second report states the currently active configuration of
the platform driver.
