The 'nic_router' component can be used to achieve a controlled mediation
between multiple NIC and Uplink sessions on network or transport level.
Sessions are assigned to router domains. The rules configured by the user then
mediate between these domains. This is a brief overview of the features thereby
provided:

* Acting as hub among NIC and Uplink sessions of the same domain,
* routing of IPv4-based UDP and TCP according to destination IP address & port,
* routing of ICMPv4 and IPv4 according to destination IP address,
* port forwarding for IPv4-based UDP and TCP,
* NAPT for IPv4-based UDP, TCP and ICMPv4 echo,
* forwarding of ICMPv4 "Destination Unreachable" according to the UDP, TCP or
  ICMPv4 echo connection it refers to,
* acting as ICMPv4 echo server per domain
* acting as DHCPv4 server or client per domain,
* provide per-domain network statistics via a report session,
* print out header information for each packet received or sent,
* and be fully re-configurable at runtime.


Functional description
======================


Interfaces and domains
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The NIC router acts as server for both Genode's NIC and Uplink service. For
both services it can manage an arbitrary number of clients at a time.
Furthermore, the NIC router can itself request multiple NIC sessions and act as
client at them. Among these types of network sessions at the router, there are
some minor differences regarding the roles when initializing the session,
determining a MAC address or communicating the link state. However, each
network session at the router, regardless of its type, is an "interface" (like
a network interface in Linux-based systems) and in all regards except the
mentioned subtleties treated the same as other interfaces.

The behavior of the router regarding interfaces is ultimately controlled
through the router's configuration. An interface that uses a NIC session that
is requested by the router (subsequently called NIC client) can be created
using the '<nic-client>' tag with an optional attribute for the session label:

! <nic-client               ... />
! <nic-client label="wifi"  ... />
! <nic-client label="wired" ... />

An interface that uses a NIC or Uplink session provided by the NIC router
(subsequently called NIC server respectively Uplink server) is created whenever
a client requests a session of one of the two service types at the router
(given the session arguments are valid).

New interfaces, although having a network session established, remain dead ends
towards the router (all packets are dropped by the router) as long as they are
not assigned a router domain. A domain is a set of router rules that is applied
as a whole to all interfaces assigned to that domain. Domains can be created by
using the '<domain>' tag with a unique name:

! <domain name="default"    ...>...<domain/>
! <domain name="servers"    ...>...<domain/>
! <domain name="home_net"   ...>...<domain/>
! <domain name="travel_net" ...>...<domain/>

The assignment of NIC clients to domains is controlled through the 'domain'
attribute in the '<nic-client>' tag:

! <nic-client                    domain="home_net" />
! <nic-client label="mobile"     domain="travel_net" />
! <nic-client label="nic_bridge" domain="home_net" />

The assignment of NIC and Uplink servers is controlled through the tags
'<policy>' and '<default-policy>' that are known from other Genode components:

! <default-policy                domain="default" />
! <policy label_prefix="vbox_"   domain="servers" />
! <policy label_suffix="_server" domain="servers" />
! <policy label="nic -> "        domain="home_net" />
! <policy label="wifi -> "       domain="public" />

Each of these tags applies to all NIC and Uplink servers whose session label
matches. A domain can be assigned any number of interfaces and interfaces of
different types.

Besides defining the router rules for assigned interfaces, domains have a
second purpose. All interfaces assigned the same domain are assumed to be in
the same IPv4 subnet. So, from the router's perspective, each domain is a
distinct IPv4 subnet. At each domain the router is represented through an
IPv4 identity local to the corresponding IPv4 subnet.

Besides being an IPv4 peer at each domain. The router is also a hub at each
domain: If a network packet must be sent at a domain, it is always sent at all
interfaces assigned that domain. If a network packet from a domain addresses a
host in the same IPv4 subnet and it's not the routers IPv4 peer in that domain,
the packet is again sent at all interfaces assigned that domain

A good analogy would be that interfaces assigned a single domain are like
network cables that are all plugged into the same hub device. There's an
additional cable going away from the hub device that directly leads to the
routers IPv4 peer in the subnet.

A domain enters an IPv4 subnet by receing an IPv4 configuration for the routers
IPv4 peer in that subnet. This configuration can be obtained statically or
dynamically using DHCP. A static configuration is applied if an 'interface'
attribute is found in the '<domain>' tag:

! <domain name="servers" interface="10.0.2.55/24" />

The attribute defines the IPv4 address of the routers peer and the address
prefix length of the corresponding subnet. If the attribute is missing the
domain automatically sends DHCP requests at all assigned interfaces in order
to obtain a dynamic IPv4 configuration (Section [Configuring DHCP client
functionality]).

Additionaly, the optional 'gateway' attribute can be set for a domain:

! <domain name="home_lan" interface="10.0.2.55/24" gateway="10.0.2.1" />

It defines the standard gateway of the subnet behind this domain. If a packet
shall be routed to this domain and its final IP destination does not match
the subnet, its Ethernet destination is set to the MAC address of the gateway.
If a gateway isn't given for a domain, such packets get dropped. If a gateway
is given for a domain without an 'interface' attribute, this gateway
configuration is not getting effective.

For each domain, the routing of packets from this domain can be configured
individually by adding subtags to the corresponding domain tag. There are
multiple types of subtags expressing different types of routing rules. The
following table gives a brief overview over the different subtags and their
meaning:

 Subtag                     | Description
---------------------------------------------------------------
 <tcp-forward port="X" />   | Port forwarding for TCP port X *
---------------------------------------------------------------
 <udp-forward port="X" />   | Port forwarding for UDP port X *
---------------------------------------------------------------
 <tcp dst="X">              | Routing TCP packets that target
    <permit-any />          | IP range X *
 </tcp>                     |
---------------------------------------------------------------
 <udp dst="X">              | Routing UDP packets that target
    <permit-any />          | IP range X *
 </udp>                     |
---------------------------------------------------------------
 <tcp dst="X">              | Routing TCP packets that target
    <permit port="Y" />     | IP range X and port Y or Z *
    <permit port="Z" />     |
 </tcp>                     |
---------------------------------------------------------------
 <udp dst="X">              | Routing UDP packets that target
    <permit port="Y" />     | IP range X and port Y or Z *
    <permit port="Z" />     |
 </udp>                     |
---------------------------------------------------------------
 <ip dst="X" />             | Routing IP packets that target
                            | IP range X
---------------------------------------------------------------
 <icmp dst="X" />           | Routing ICMP packets that target
                            | IP range X

A detailed explanation of the different routing rules is given in the
following sections of this document. For all rules marked with a star, the
router also keeps track of corresponding TCP connections and UDP
pseudo-connections. With these so-called link states, corresponding reply
packets are automatically routed back. The user doesn't have to add an
additional back-routing rule for that.

Now having this variety of ways of routing a packet, it is absolutely legal
that for one packet the domain may contain multiple rules that are applicable.
And additionally, there may even be a link state that fits. The router's
choice, however, is always deterministic. It follows this priority scheme:

:For TCP and UDP:

1) Domain-local IP traffic
2) Link states
3) Port forwarding rules
4) Longest prefix match amongst TCP respectively UDP rules
   4.1) Subrule that permits any port
   4.2) Subrules that permit specific ports
5) Longest prefix match amongst IP rules

:For ICMP "Echo":

1) Domain-local IP traffic
2) Link states
3) Longest prefix match amongst ICMP rules
4) Longest prefix match amongst IP rules

:For ICMP "Destination Unreachable" with embedded UDP, TCP or ICMP "Echo":

1) Domain-local IP traffic
2) Link states
3) Longest prefix match amongst IP rules

:For IP with unsupported transport-layer protocol:

1) Domain-local IP traffic
2) Longest prefix match amongst IP rules


IP rules
~~~~~~~~

These are examples for IP rules:

! <ip dst="10.0.2.0/24"     domain="intranet"  />
! <ip dst="192.168.1.18/32" domain="my_server" />
! <ip dst="0.0.0.0/0"       domain="default"    />

IP rules only apply to IPv4 packets from interfaces of the surrounding
domain. The 'dst' attribute is compared with the IP destination of the packet.
The rule with the longest prefix match is taken. The packet is then routed to
the domain given in the rule.

IP rules work pretty simple. They merely affect the Ethernet header of a
packet and they don't imply link-state tracking. This has consequences. First,
IP rules do not automatically route back reply packets from the remote side.
If you like to enable bidirectional communication via IP rules, both domains
must have an appropriate rule in their domain tag. And second, IP rules do not
consider a NAT configuration (Section [Configuring NAT]). As this could lead
to unexpected leakage of local IP addresses and ports, you should use the
combination of IP rules and NAT only with great care.


ICMP rules
~~~~~~~~~~

These are examples for ICMP rules:

! <icmp dst="10.0.2.0/24"     domain="intranet"  />
! <icmp dst="192.168.1.18/32" domain="my_server" />
! <icmp dst="0.0.0.0/0"       domain="default"    />

ICMP rules only apply to ICMP "Echo" packets from interfaces of the surrounding
domain. The 'dst' attribute is compared with the IP destination of the packet.
The rule with the longest prefix match is taken. The packet is then routed to
the domain given in the rule.

For bidirectional traffic, you'll need only one ICMP rule describing the
client-to-server direction. The server-sided domain doesn't need a rule as the
router correlates replies to the client-sided rule (and only those) via a link
state (Section [Link states]) that was created at the clients initial request.

ICMP rules consider whether the router shall apply NAT (Section [Configuring
NAT]) for the client side. If this is the case, source IP and ICMP query ID
are replaced by the router's IP identity and a free ICMP query ID at the
server-sided domain. Also the corresponding link state takes this in account
to change back the destination of the replies.

The router also forwards ICMP errors. This is described in section
[Link states].


TCP and UDP rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TCP and UDP rules must always be accompanied by one or more port permission
rules to get effective:

! <tcp dst="192.168.1.18/32">
!    <permit port="70" domain="gopher_servers" />
!    <permit port="80" domain="http_servers" />
! </tcp>
! <udp dst="10.0.2.0/24">
!    <permit-any domain="default" />
! </udp>

TCP rules only apply to TCP packets and UDP rules only to UDP packets from
interfaces of the surrounding domain. The 'dst' attribute is compared with the
IP destination of the packet. The rule with the longest prefix match is taken.
If the rule contains a 'permit-any' subrule or a 'permit' subrule whose 'port'
attribute matches the destination port of the packet, the packet is routed to
the domain given in the subrule.

For bidirectional traffic, you'll need only one TCP or UDP rule describing the
client-to-server direction. The server-sided domain doesn't need a rule as the
router correlates replies to the client-sided rule (and only those) via a link
state (Section [Link states]) that was created at the clients initial request.

TCP and UDP rules consider whether the router shall apply NAT
(Section [Configuring NAT]) for the client side. If this is the case, source
IP and port are replaced by the router's IP identity and a free port at the
server-sided domain. Also the corresponding link state takes this in account
to change back the destination of the replies.


Port-forwarding rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are examples for port-forwarding rules:

! <tcp-forward port="80" domain="http_servers" to="192.168.1.18" to_port="1234" />
! <udp-forward port="69" domain="tftp_servers" to="192.168.2.23" />

Port-forwarding rules only apply to packets that come from interfaces of the
surrounding domain and are addressed to the router's IP identity at this domain
(Section [Basics]). Amongst those, 'tcp-forward' rules only apply to the TCP
packets and 'udp-forward' rules only to the UDP packets. The 'port' attribute
is compared with the packet's destination port. If a matching rule is found,
the IP destination of the packet is changed to the value of the 'to' attribute.
If the 'to_port' attribute is set and not zero, the packet's destination port
is changed to the attribute value. Then, the packet is routed to the domain
given in the rule. Note that the router accepts only system and registered
ports other than zero (1 to 49151) for port forwarding.

For bidirectional traffic, you'll need only one port-forwarding rule
describing the client-to-server direction. The server-sided domain doesn't
need a rule as the router correlates replies to the client-sided rule (and
only those) via a link state (Section [Link states]) that was created at the
clients initial request.

It's in the nature of port forwarding that it comes along with NAT for the
server side. However, the router only translates the server IP. The port
remains unchanged. For the client side, port-forwarding rules apply NAT only
when configured (Section [Configuring NAT]). If this is the case, client IP
and port are translated.


Link states
~~~~~~~~~~~

Each time a packet gets routed by using a TCP, UDP, ICMP or port-forwarding
rule, the router creates a link state. From then on, all packets that belong
to the exchange this first packet initiated and come from one of the two
involved domains are routed by the link state and not by a rule. The costs for
the link state are paid by the interface that sent the first packet.

If a link state exists for a packet, it is unambiguously correlated either
through source IP and port plus destination IP and port or, for ICMP, through
source and destination IP plus ICMP query ID. This is also the case if the
transfer includes NAT no matter of what kind or for which side.

It is desirable to discard a link state as soon as it is not needed anymore.
The more precise this is done, the more efficient can interfaces use their
resources (ports, RAM), and the less is the risk for DoS attacks. Therefore,
the NIC router keeps track of the idle time of a link. Idle time means the
time passed since the last packet was routed using that link regardless of
the direction or content of that packet. The amount of idle time at which
the NIC router shall discard a link state can be configured in the <config>
tag of the router for each link type separately:

! <config udp_idle_timeout_sec="30"
!         tcp_idle_timeout_sec="50"
!         icmp_idle_timeout_sec="5">

This would set the maximum ICMP idle time to 5, the maximum UDP idle time to
30 and the maximum TCP idle time to 50 seconds. You should choose these values
with care. If they are too low, replies that normally need no routing rule may
get lost. If it is too high, link states are held longer than necessary.

For UDP and ICMP link states, this timeout is the only condition that leads to
a discard. This is better known as hole punching. It allows peers to keep
alive a UDP or ICMP pseudo-connection through the router by frequently sending
empty packets. The need for such a pseudo-connection arises from the router's
demand to support NAT for UDP and ICMP transfers and the consequence of
keeping the corresponding mapping information.

The lifetime management of TCP link states, in contrast, is more complex. In
addition to the common timeout, they may be discarded also after the router
observed the four-way termination handshake of TCP plus a duration of two
times the maximum segment lifetime. The maximum segment lifetime can be be set
in the <config> tag too:

! <config tcp_max_segm_lifetime_sec="20">

As long as there is a link state for a connection, the router also forwards
ICMP "Destination Unreachable" packets that contain a packet of this
connection embedded in their payload. The embedded packet is adapted according
to the NAT configuration of the link state as well as the outer IPv4 packet
that contains the ICMP.


Configuring NAT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In contrast to routing rules that affect packets coming from their domain,
NAT rules affect packets that go to their domain:

! <domain name="home_lan" interface="10.0.2.55/24">
!    <nat domain="http_client" tcp-ports="6" />
! </domain>

This would tell the router to apply NAT for the HTTP client when it speaks to
the home LAN. This means, it affects all packets from the HTTP client that get
routed to the home LAN by using a UDP, TCP, or port-forwarding rule
respectively a corresponding link state. If this is the case, the packet's
source IP address is changed to "10.0.2.55" and the source port is replaced by
a free source port of the router. When saying "free source port" this actually
means a port that the router currently doesn't use at the destination domain.
So, at each domain, the router has two complete port spaces for source NAT
available. One for UDP and one for TCP. Each port space contains the IANA
dynamic port range 49152 to 65535.

As you can see, the NAT rule also has a 'tcp-ports' attribute. It restricts how
many TCP source ports of the home LAN the HTTP client may use at a time. The
same goes also for UDP:

! <nat domain="tftp_client" udp-ports="13" />

And even combined:

! <nat domain="intranet" tcp-ports="43" udp-ports="21" />

The same goes for ICMP query IDs:

! <nat domain="intranet" tcp-ports="43" udp-ports="21" icmp-ids="102" />

If one of the port or ID attributes is not set, this means that no port or ID
shall be used for this protocol which effectively disables it. Thus, at least
one of these attributes must be set for the NAT rule to be sensible.
Restricting the port usage is necessary to avoid that a client can run
Denial-of-Service attacks against the destination domain by occupying all of
its ports or IDs.


Configuring ICMP-Echo-server functionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ICMP-Echo-server functionality of the router has the following
configuration attributes (default values shown):

! <config icmp_echo_server="yes">
!    <domain icmp_echo_server="yes" ... />
! </config>

The icmp_echo_server attribute configures whether the router answers ICMP Echo
requests that address the router. The <config> value affects all domains
without a <domain> local value.


Configuring DHCP server functionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One can configure the NIC router to act as DHCP server at interfaces of a
domain by adding the <dhcp> tag to the configuration of the domain like
this:

! <domain name="vbox" interface="10.0.1.1/24">
!
!     <dhcp-server ip_first="10.0.1.80"
!                  ip_last="10.0.1.100"
!                  ip_lease_time_sec="3600">
!
!         <dns-domain name="genodians.org" />
!         <dns-server ip="8.8.8.8" />
!         <dns-server ip="1.1.1.1" />
!         ...
!
!     </dhcp-server>
!     ...
!
! </domain>

or like this:

! <domain name="vbox" interface="10.0.1.1/24">
!
!     <dhcp-server ip_first="10.0.1.80"
!                  ip_last="10.0.1.100"
!                  ip_lease_time_sec="3600"
!                  dns_config_from="home_lan" />
!     ...
!
! </domain>

The mandatory attributes 'ip_first' and 'ip_last' define the available IPv4
address range while the optional attribute 'ip_lease_time_sec' defines the
lifetime of an IPv4 address assignment in seconds. The IPv4 address range must
be in the subnet defined by the 'interface' attribute of the <domain> tag and
must not cover the IPv4 address given by this attribute.

The <dns-domain> sub-tag from the first example statically provides a DNS
domain name that shall be propagated by the DHCP server through a DHCP option
15 entry to its clients.

The <dns-server> sub-tags from the first example statically provide a list of
DNS server addresses that shall be propagated by the DHCP server through a DHCP
option 6 entry to its clients. These addresses might be of any IP subnet. The
addresses in the DHCP option 6 entry in the DHCP replies will have the same
order as the <dns-server> tags in the configuration.

The 'dns_config_from' attribute from the second example takes effect only when
the <dhcp-server> tag does not contain any <dns-domain> or <dns-server>
sub-tags. The attribute states the domain from whose IP config to take the DNS
domain name and the list of DNS server addresses that shall be propagated. Note
that the order of DNS server adresses is not altered thereby. This is useful in
scenarios where these addresses must be obtained dynamically through the DHCP
client of another domain.

There is an additional feature the router implements together with the
'dns_config_from' functionality. If a domain has a DHCP server with a
'dns_config_from' value that denominates another valid domain, the link state
of all interfaces, where the router is a NIC session server, at the first
domain becomes bound to the validity of the IP config of the second domain.

One motivation for having this feature is to optimize the network boot-up time
of application clients of the NIC router by preventing DHCP re-attempt
timeouts. Such timeouts would occur because clients attempt DHCP as soon as
their interface goes up and without the extra feature, the DHCP server would
potentially not be ready yet.

But this feature is not only an optimization. It also implies that whenever the
domain denominated by 'dns_config_from' receives a new IP config with a new DNS
configuration, application clients are poked via a link state "down-up"
sequence to re-request DHCP and thereby update their DNS configuration. I.e. it
enables dynamic DNS config propagation.

However, please be aware this feature is limited to applications that connect
directly and via a NIC session client to the NIC router. This is due to two
technical limitations. First, the router can't control the link state at
interfaces where he acts as NIC session client or Uplink session server. And
second, the router can't ensure that link state changes reach the client if
there are intermediate network components like a NIC bridge.

The lifetime of an IP address assignment that was yet only offered to the
client can be configured for all domains in the <config> tag of the router:

! <config dhcp_offer_timeout_sec="6">

The timeout 'ip_lease_time_sec' is applied only when the offer is acknowledged
by the client in time.


Configuring DHCP client functionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the attribute 'interface' is not set in a 'domain' tag, the router tries to
dynamically receive and maintain an IP configuration for that domain by using
DHCP in the client role at all interfaces that connect to the domain. In the
DHCP discover phase, the router simply chooses the first DHCP offer that
arrives. So, no comparison of different DHCP offers is done. In the DHCP
request phase, the server is expected to provide an IP address, a gateway, a
subnet mask, and an IP lease time to the router. If anything substantial goes
wrong during a DHCP exchange, the router discards the outcome of the exchange
and goes back to the DHCP discover phase. At any time where there is no valid
IP configuration present at a domain, the domain does only act as DHCP client
and all other router functionality is disabled for the domain. A domain cannot
act as DHCP client and DHCP server at once. So, a 'domain' tag must either
have an 'interface' attribute or must not contain a 'dhcp-server' tag.

The timeouts when waiting for the reply of DHCP discover messages and for DHCP
request messages can be configured for all domains in the <config> tag of the
router:

! <config dhcp_discover_timeout_sec="10"
!         dhcp_request_timeout_sec="6">


Configuring reporting functionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The NIC router can be configured to send reports about its state.

Configuration example (shows default values of attributes):

! <config>
!    <report bytes="yes"
!            stats="yes"
!            dropped_fragm_ipv4="yes"
!            quota="yes"
!            config="yes"
!            config_triggers="no"
!            link_state="yes"
!            link_state_triggers="no"
!            interval_sec="5"/>
! </config>

If the 'report' tag is not available, no reports are send.
A complete state report of the NIC router is structured the following way
(example):

! <state>
!   <ram quota="15715577" used="7589888" shared="16384"/>
!   <cap quota="431" used="184" shared="4"/>
!
!   <domain name="domain_1" rx_bytes="17597" tx_bytes="7788"
!           ipv4="100.200.0.10/24" gw="100.200.0.1">
!

!     <dns ip="100.200.0.8"/>

!     <icmp-links> ... </icmp-links>

!       <destroyed value="16"/>

! </state>

The attributes of the <report> tag correspond to the report content as
described below:

'bytes'

A boolean value that controls whether the attributes 'rx_bytes' and 'tx_bytes'
of the <domain> tag in the state report are generated. These attributes
provide the number of bytes that were sent respectively recieved at all
interfaces of that domain beginning with the creation of the domain.

'stats'

A boolean value that controls whether the subtags <udp-links>, <tcp-links>,
<icmp-links>, <dhcp-allocations>, and <arp-waiters> are generated in the tags
<domain> and <interface>. In the <interface> tag, these subtags provide further
subtags <opening>, <open>, <closing>, <closed> that provide the number of links
of the protocol type that are currently in the denominated protocol state (a
missing subtag denominates a number of 0).

Furthermore, there are subtags <dissolved_*> that provide the number of links
of the protocol type that were already dissolved by the router (i.e., they are
already non-effective) but that weren't destructed so far. Thereby, the
different <dissolved_*> tags group the links according to the reason why they
have been dissolved (<dissolved_no_timeout> thereby means that the protocol
itself terminated the connection).

The <destroyed> subtag can occur in <*-links> subtags in both the <interface>
and the <domain> tag. It shows the number of links of the protocol type that
once existed but were already destroyed. In case of the <interface> tag, the
corresponding interface still exists at that domain. Once the interface gets
destroyed or disconnected from the domain, the number is transferred to the
<destroyed> subtag in the <*-links> subtag in the <domain> tag. I.e. the
<destroyed> subtags in <*-links> subtags in the <domain> tag provide the number
of destroyed links that can't be correlated anymore to any interface of the
domain.

The same applies for the <refused_*> subtags of <*-links> tags. They show the
number of links that couldn't be established through the router because of the
lack of a certain quota. Thereby, <refused_for_ram> refers to a lack of RAM
quota at the source interface of the link. The <refused_for_ports>, at the
other hand, refers to a lack of UDP/TCP-NAT-ports respectively ICMP-NAT-IDs at
the target domain (see section [Configuring NAT]).

The subtags <arp-waiters>, and <dhcp-allocations> list the number of still
active (<active> subtag) and already destroyed (<destroyed> subtag) objects for
pending ARP requests respectively DHCP-address allocations at an interface when
in an <interface> tag. When in a <domain> tag, they only list the number of
already destroyed objects of these types that can't be correlated anymore to
any interface of the domain.

'dropped-fragm-ipv4'

A boolean value that controls whether the subtag <dropped-fragm-ipv4> is
generated in the tags <interface> and <domain>. When in an <interface> tag, the
value shows the number of packets that were dropped at the corresponding
interface because they were fragmented IPv4 (which is not supported). When in a
<domain> tag, the value refers to the number of dropped fragmented IPv4 packets
that can't be correlated to any interface of the domain anymore.

'quota'

A boolean value that controls whether the subtags <ram> and <cap> of the
<state> tag and the subtags <ram-quota> and <cap-quota> of the <interface>
tag are generated.

The former two show the capability quota respectively RAM quota of the router
that isn't accounted to any of the interfaces connected to the router (i.e.,
the routers "own" quota). The 'quota' attribute denotes the total amount of
quota available to the router, the 'used' attribute the part of the total
amount of quota that is currently spent or in use, and the 'shared' attribute
the part of the spent quota that, although it was spent for interface-specific
things, can't be accounted to one interface for technical reasons.

The subtags <ram-quota> and <cap-quota> in the <interface> tag, however, show
the capability quota respectively RAM quota accounted to that interface. The
'limit' and 'used' attributes are equal to the 'quota' and 'used' attributes of
the <ram> and <cap> subtags of the <state> tag. The 'avail' attribute contains
simply the 'limit' value minus the 'used' value.

'config'

A boolean value that controls whether the attributes 'ipv4' and 'gw' of the
<domain> tag and the subtags <dns> and <dns-domain> in the <domain> tag are
generated. The attribute 'ipv4' contains the current IPv4 address of the router
in this domain suffixed by the length of the subnet prefix in bits. The 'gw'
attribute contains the IPv4 address of the gateway in this domain. Each <dns>
subtag of a <domain> tag shows the IPv4 address of a DNS server known to this
domain. The <dns> subtags have the same order that the addresses had in the
DHCP option 6 entry of the DHCP reply that the router received and that led to
the current IPv4 configuration of the domain. The <dns-domain> subtag of the
<domain> tag states the DNS domain name of this domain if any.

'config_triggers'

A boolean value that controls whether to enforce sending a report each time the
state that is controlled through the 'config' attribute of the <report> tag
changes. I.e., whenever the IP configuration of any domain has changed.

'link_state'

A boolean value that controls whether the attribute 'link_state' of the
<interface> tag is generated. The 'link_state' attribute shows the current real
link state of the interface. Note, that in case of a NIC server, this is not
necessarily the same value as the one that the session client sees. For more
information on that, refer to [Behavior regarding the NIC-session link state].

'link_state_triggers'

A boolean value that controls whether to enforce sending a report whenever the
real link state (see description of the 'link_state' attribute) of any
interface at the router has changed. Note that whenever an interface is created
or destroyed this is considered a change of its real link state.

'interval_sec'

Defines the interval in seconds in which to unconditionally send a report.
Must not be 0.


Verbosity
~~~~~~~~~

This is how you can configure the routers verbosity on its environment LOG
session (default values shown):

! <config verbose="no">

Whether to log router decisions and optional hints.

! <config verbose_packets="no" ... >
!     <domain verbose_packets="no" ... />
! </config>

Whether to log most important protocol header fields of each packet that is
received or sent (ETH, IPv4, ARP, UDP, TCP, DHCP, ICMP). The <config> value
affects all domains without a <domain> local value.

! <config verbose_packet_drop="no" ... >
!     <domain verbose_packet_drop="no" ... />
! </config>

Whether to log each packet drop and the rational behind it. The <config> value
affects all domains without a <domain> local value.

! <config verbose_domain_state="no">

Whether to log most important changes in the state of a domain (number of
interfaces assigned, current IPv4 config).


Tracing
~~~~~~~

You can use Genode's TRACE service to capture all packets that traverse the
router. This requires a monitor component such as the trace-recorder component
that provides and activates a corresponding trace buffer and trace policy.
More precisely, packet tracing is realised via the 'trace_eth_packet()' hook
that needs to be implemented by the trace policy. Note that packet tracing must
also be enabled in the router configuration.

This is how you can configure whether to trace packets (default values shown):

! <config trace_packets="no">
!     <domain trace_packets="no" ... />
! </config>

If enabled, 'trace_eth_packet()' is called for every packet received or sent by
the router. The attribute in the <domain> tag applies only for packets
received and sent by that domain. The attribute in the <config> tag sets the
default value for all <domain> tags without a local setting.


Other configuration attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ICMP response to dropped fragmented IPv4
----------------------------------------

The NIC router can notify the sender of a fragmented IPv4 that was dropped by
the router (because fragmented IPv4 isn't supported) via an ICMP type-3
(destination unreachable) packet. This is the attribute that controls this
functionality:

! <config icmp_type_3_code_on_fragm_ipv4="4">

If not set, the value of the attribute defaults to "no" which results in not
sending the above mentioned packets on dropped fragmented IPv4 (i.e.,
fragmented IPv4 gets dropped silently). If the value is set to a number in the
range from 0 to 15, the above mentioned ICMP responses are sent and the value
indicates which value the ICMP code field should have in the responses. If the
value is set to something else than "no" or a number in the range from 0 to 15,
the router prints a warning to the log and assumes value "no".


Maximum number of packets handled per signal
--------------------------------------------

If possible, the NIC router normally handles multiple packets from an interface
per signal. However, if one interface has a high packet rate and a big buffer,
this can lead to starvation of the other interfaces. Thus, the maximum number
of packets handled per signal is limited by default. This limit can be
configured as follows (default value shown):

! <config max_packets_per_signal="150">

When set to zero, the limit is deactivated, meaning that the router always
handles all available packets of an interface.


Disable requesting address resolutions via ARP
----------------------------------------------

By default, the NIC router requests required IP-to-MAC address resolutions at a
domain using ARP. However this may be a problem in certain environments, e.g.,
when being connected to an LTE modem that doesn't forward ARP. In order to
deal with such scenarios, one can disable ARP requests at a domain by setting
the flag 'use_arp' to 'no' (default is 'yes'):

! <config ... >
!     <domain use_arp="no" ... />
! <config/>

Whenever the NIC router has to send a packet at a domain with 'use_arp="no"',
it will set the destination MAC-address of the packet to equal the source
MAC-address of the packet (instead of requesting the destination MAC-address
via ARP). This behavior was observed in common Linux-based systems at network
interfaces with the 'NOARP' flag set.


Behavior regarding the NIC-session link state
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At NIC servers, the NIC router applies a feedback-driven state machine for the
link state in order to ensure that clients recognize state transitions. This
means that the NIC router guarantees that a new link state remains fixed until
the client has read it using the corresponding RPC at the NIC-session
interface. If, in the meantime, further "up" and "down" edges occur, they are
memorized and executed as soon as the former state has been read by the client.
Such postponed link state edges are merged in a way that they result in two
contrary edges at a max. The following diagrams demonstrate this:


! client reads:      0         1      0       1    0          1
!                         _____        _______           _________________
! client link state: ____|     |______|       |_________|
!                         _       __________             _________________

Examples
========

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In-action examples of how to use the router are provided through the following
automated run scripts:

* libports/run/nic_router.run          (basic functionality)
* dde_linux/run/nic_router_uplinks.run (dynamically switching between wifi and wired driver)

* os/run/nic_router_flood.run          (client misbehaving on protocol level)
* os/run/nic_router_stress.run         (client misbehaving on session level)

The rest of this section will list and explain some smaller configuration
snippets. The environment for these examples shall be as follows. There are two
virtual subnets 192.168.1.0/24 and 192.168.2.0/24 that connect as Virtnet A and
B to the router. The standard gateway of the virtual networks is the NIC router
with IP 192.168.*.1 . The NIC driver connects the machine with your home
network 10.0.2.0/24 and has an Uplink session to the NIC router.  Your home
network is connected to the internet through its standard gateway 10.0.2.1 .


Connecting local networks
-------------------------

Let's assume we simply want the virtual networks and the home network to be
able to talk to each other. Furthermore, the virtual networks shall be able to
use the internet connection of your home network. The router would have the
following configuration:

! <policy label_prefix="virtnet_a" domain="virtnet_a" />
! <policy label_prefix="virtnet_b" domain="virtnet_b" />
! <policy label_prefic="nic"       domain="home_lan"  />
!
! <domain name="home_lan" interface="10.0.2.55/24" gateway="10.0.2.1">
!    <ip dst="192.168.1.0/24" domain="virtnet_a"/>
!    <ip dst="192.168.2.0/24" domain="virtnet_b"/>
! </domain>
!
! <domain name="virtnet_a" interface="192.168.1.1/24">
!    <ip dst="192.168.2.0/24" domain="virtnet_b"/>
!    <ip dst="0.0.0.0/0"      domain="home_lan"/>
! </domain>
!
! <domain name="virtnet_b" interface="192.168.2.1/24">
!    <ip dst="192.168.1.0/24" domain="virtnet_a"/>
!    <ip dst="0.0.0.0/0"      domain="home_lan"/>
! </domain>

IP packets from Virtnet A and the home LAN that target an IP address
192.168.2.* are routed to Virtnet B. IP packets from Virtnet B and the home LAN
that target an IP address 192.168.1.* are routed to Virtnet A. Packets that are
addressed to hosts in the same local network should never reach the router as
they can be transmitted directly. If there's a packet from one of the virtual
networks that doesn't target 192.168.1.* or 192.168.2.*, the IP 0.0.0.0/0 rules
route them to the home LAN. If these packets target an IP 10.0.2.*, the router
sends them directly to the host in your home network. Otherwise, the router
sends them to your gateway 10.0.2.1 . Note that none of the packets is modified
on layer 2 or higher, so, no NAT is done by the router to hide the virtual
networks.


Clients in a private network
----------------------------

Now we have some clients in Virtnet A that like to talk to the internet as
well as to the home network. We want them to be hidden via NAT when they do so
and to be limited to HTTP+TLS/SSL and IMAP+TLS/SSL when talking to the
internet. The router would have the following configuration:

! <policy label_prefix="virtnet_a" domain="virtnet_a" />
! <policy label_prefix="virtnet_b" domain="virtnet_b" />
! <policy label_prefic="nic"       domain="home_lan"  />
!
! <domain name="home_lan" interface="10.0.2.55/24" gateway="10.0.2.1">
!    <nat domain="virtnet_a" tcp_ports="1000" udp_ports="1000">
! </domain>
!
! <domain name="virtnet_a" interface="192.168.1.1/24">
!    <tcp dst="10.0.2.0/24"><permit-any domain="home_lan" /></tcp>
!    <udp dst="10.0.2.0/24"><permit-any domain="home_lan" /></udp>
!    <tcp dst="0.0.0.0/0">
!       <permit port="443" domain="home_lan" />
!       <permit port="993" domain="home_lan" />
!    </tcp>
! </domain>

From the packets that come from Virtnet A, those that target an IP 10.0.2.* are
routed to the home LAN without inspecting the port. At the home LAN, the router
notices that it shall apply NAT for Virtnet A. It replaces the source IP with
10.0.2.55 and allocates a free source port of the home LAN for the exchange. On
replies to Virtnet-A packets from the home network, the router translates IP
and port back using the corresponding link state. For packets from Virtnet A
that target other IPs, only the 0.0.0.0/0 rule applies and only if the packet
targets TCP port 443 or 993. Both ports route the packet to the home LAN where,
again, NAT is applied and the packets are sent to the gateway 10.0.2.1 .


Servers in a private network
----------------------------

In this example, we assume that the NIC router has to request a NIC session at
a NIC bridge instance in order to reach the NIC driver (the driver serves the
NIC bridge) and gain access to the home LAN. Furthermore, there are three
servers in Virtnet A. An HTTP server at port 80 with IP 192.168.1.2, a GOPHER
server at port 70 with IP 192.168.1.3, and a TFTP server at port 69 with IP
192.168.1.4 . Now, you want the servers (and only them) to be reachable to the
home network via the router's IP and to the internet via your gateway. The
router would have the following configuration:

! <policy label_prefix="virtnet_a" domain="virtnet_a" />
! <policy label_prefix="virtnet_b" domain="virtnet_b" />
! <nic-client                      domain="home_lan"  />
!
! <domain name="home_lan" interface="10.0.2.55/24" gateway="10.0.2.1">
!    <tcp-forward port="80" domain="virtnet_a" to="192.168.1.2" />
!    <tcp-forward port="70" domain="virtnet_a" to="192.168.1.3" />
!    <udp-forward port="69" domain="virtnet_a" to="192.168.1.4" to_port="2048"/>
! </domain>
!
! <domain name="virtnet_a" interface="192.168.1.1/24" />
! <domain name="virtnet_b" interface="192.168.1.1/24" />

Amongst the packets that come from the home LAN, only those that are addressed
to 10.0.2.55 and TCP port 80, TCP port 70, or UDP port 69 are forwarded.
All these packets are forwarded to Virtnet A. But beforehand, their IP
destination is adapted. TCP-port-80 packets are redirected to 192.168.1.2,
TCP-port-70 packets to 192.168.1.3, and UDP-port-69 packets to
192.168.1.4:2048.

Amongst the packets that come from Virtnet A, only those that match a link
state at the home LAN are forwarded, because the Virtnet-A domain contains no
rules. Thus, Virtnet A can only talk to the home LAN in the context of
TCP-connections or UDP pseudo-connections that were opened by clients behind
the home LAN. The servers IP addresses never leave Virtnet A.
