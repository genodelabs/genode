The ROM filter provides a ROM module that depends on the content
of other ROM modules. Its designated use is the dynamic switching between
configuration variants dependent on the state of the system. For example,
the configuration of the window decorator may be toggled depending on whether
nitpicker's X-ray mode is active or not.


Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The configuration consists of two parts. The first part is the declaration of
input values that are taken into the account. The input values are obtained
from ROM modules that contain XML-formatted data. Each input value is
represented by an '<input>' node with a unique 'name' attribute. The 'rom'
attribute specifies the ROM module to take the input from. If not specified,
the 'name' is used as the ROM name. The type of the top-level XML node can be
specified via the 'node' attribute. If not present, the top-level XML node is
expected to correspond to the 'name' attribute.

The second part of the configuration defines the output via an '<output>' node.
The type of the top-level XML node must be specified via the 'node' attribute.
The '<output>' node can contain the following sub nodes:

:'<inline>':
  Contains content to be written to the output.

:'<if>':
  Produces output depending on a condition (see below). If the condition
  is satisfied, the '<then>' sub node is evaluated. Otherwise, the '<else>'
  sub node is evaluated. Each of those sub nodes can contain the same
  nodes as the '<output>' node.


Conditions
----------

The '<has_value>' condition compares an input value (specified as 'input'
attribute) with a predefined value (specified as 'value' attribute). The
condition is satisfied if both values are equal.
