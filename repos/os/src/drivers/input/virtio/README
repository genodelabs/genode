The VirtIO input driver makes it possible to read input events from
Qemu keyboard, mouse, or tablet devices and feed them to Genode Event
session.

By default the driver can attach to any supported device type. This
may be changed by specifying "match_product" configuration key. Allowed
values for this setting are: keyboard, mouse, tablet, any (default).

For example, to make sure specific instance of this driver attaches only
to VirtIO keyboard device it can be configured as:

! <config match_product="keyboard" />
