This directory contains an USB Mass Storage Bulk-Only driver. It uses
the Usb session interface to access the USB device and provides Genode's
Block service to its client.

Behavior
--------

This driver only supports USB Mass Storage Bulk-Only devices that use the
SCSI Block Commands set (direct-access). Devices using different command
sets, e.g, SD/HC devices or some external disc drives will not work properly
if at all. The following configuration snippets demonstrates how to use the
driver:

!<start name="usb_block_drv">
!  <resource name="RAM" quantum="4M"/>
!  <provides> <service name="Block"/> </provides>
!  <config label="usb_stick" report="yes" writeable="yes" interface="0" lun="0"/>
!  <route>
!   <service name="Usb"> <child name="usb_drv"/> </service>
!   <any-service> <parent/> <any-child/> </any-service>
!  </route>
!</start>

The drivers 'config' node features a few attributes. First, there is the 'label'
attribute. This attribute specifies the label used when opening the Usb session
connection. A matching policy has to be configured at the USB host controller
driver:

!<start name="usb_drv">
!  <resource name="RAM" quantum="8M"/>
!  <provides><service name="Usb"/></provides>
!  <config uhci="yes" ehci="yes" xhci="yes">
!    <raw>
!        <policy label="usb_block_drv -> usb_stick" vendor_id="0x13fe" product_id="0x5200"/>
!    </raw>
!  </config>
!</start>

For static configurations the 'label' value may be chosen freely or may even
be ommitted entirely. On the other hand it is best for dynamic configurations
to choose a unique label, e.g. 'usb-<bus>-<dev>', at run-time (this most likely
involves other components that generate configurations for the 'usb_block_drv'
as well as the 'usb_drv').


The second attribute is 'report'. If its value is 'yes' the driver
will generate a 'devices' report that contains meta information about the
USB device it is accessing and hence the Block session it is provding, e.g.:

!<devices>
!  <device vendor="QEMU" product="QEMU USB HARDDRIVE" block_size="512" block_count="8192" writeable="no"/>
!</devices>

The report contains a 'device' node that includes the device's vendor name and
the product description as well as its block size and the number of blocks.
Although the parent node is called 'devices' the driver is only able to access
one and the same device and the report will therefore always contain one device
only.

In addition to other attributes that can be used to configure sepecific aspects
of the driver. The 'writeable' attribute denotes the permission of the Block
session client to write to the USB device. Independent thereof the driver will
query the device and will set the Block session operations accordingly. The
'interface' specifies the USB interface the driver should use. If the device
provides multiple SCSI devices the 'lun' attribute is used to select the right
one.

The configuration of the USB block driver cannot be changed at run-time. The
driver is either used in a static system configuration where it is configured
once or in case of a dynamic system configuration a new driver instance with
a proper configuration is created on demand.
