This directory contains the implementation of Genode's AHCI driver

Behavior
--------

The driver supports x86 32/64 bit platforms and the Exynos5 SOC. If
more than one AHCI controller is present, the first one will be used.
Each active device on each AHCI port will be represented by a Genode
block session. The server must be configured via a policy, that states
which client can access a certain device:


!<start name="ahci">
!  <binary name="ahci_drv" />
!  <resource name="RAM" quantum="10M" />
!  <provides><service name="Block" /></provides> }
!  <route>
!    <any-service> <parent /> <any-child /> </any-service>
!  </route>
!  <config atapi="no">
!    <!-- use model and serial number -->
!    <policy label="test-ahci" model="QEMU HARDDISK" serial="QM00005" />
!    <!-- use controller port number -->
!    <policy label="bench" device="1" />
!  </config>
!</start>

In the example above, a session request labeled with "test-ahci" gains access to
a device with certain model and serial numbers, while "bench" gains access to
device at port 1. ATAPI support is by default disabled and can be enabled by
setting the config attribute "atapi" to "yes".
