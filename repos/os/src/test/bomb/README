The bomb test starts as many components as configured and as RAM
resources admit. This utilitiy acts as a fork bomb to stress test core, init,
and of course the kernel.

The master component (bomb-master) starts a given number of children and it
donates the available memory in equal shares to the children. The children
again start new children until all their memory resources are depleted or a
given generation count of children is reached (depth of the fork tree).
The bomb-master begins to kill all children after a given period of time and
restarts the creation of children afterwards.

Configuration
-------------

! ...
! <config rounds="1" generations="1" children="2" sleep="2000" demand="1048576"/>
! ...

rounds:      solely used by master bomb - number of start/kill rounds
generations: maximum generations of children, i.e. tree depth, to create
children:    number of children per bomb parent to create
sleep:       time in ms to wait between creation and killing of children by
             bomb-master
demand:      amount of RAM in bytes which are required to spawn a new child

The xml attributes are all optional. If the XML attributes are not set,
the values given in the example config are used as default by the bomb-master.
