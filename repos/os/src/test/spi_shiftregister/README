spi_shiftregister uses loopback ability of the spi controller to shift any
burst from the TX line to the RX line of that same controller. This enables us to
test the spi driver without any device connected to the bus.

The client does not require any specific configuration. As explained in the spi readme
the session policy can predefine session's settings. Those settings can also be
set programmatically by the client. Please have a look at the spi driver RPC's interface
in 'os/include/spi_session/spi_session.h'.
