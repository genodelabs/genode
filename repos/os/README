This is the example operating system based on the Genode OS framework:

:_Init_: is the first real process in the system. The provided implementation
  uses a very simple XML parser to read its configuration files.

:_Drivers_: The example OS has basic drivers for frame buffer, mouse and
  keyboard input, the PCI bus, the real-time clock, and system-specific timers.

:_Server_: The only server in the example OS is Nitpicker, a
  minimal-complexity GUI server.

:_Test_: are also part of the example OS. You may have a look at the fork
  bomb as a simple system stress test.

:_Ldso_: is the dynamic linker used for loading executables that are linked
  against shared libraries.

:_Lib_: contains libraries used by the components of the OS repository,
  for example, the alarm framework.
