/*
 * \brief  Report session interface
 * \author Norman Feske
 * \date   2014-01-10
 *
 * A report session allows a client to report status information about itself
 * to the outer world, in particular to its parent process.
 *
 * The communication between client and server is based on the combination
 * of shared memory with synchronous RPC. A dataspace shared between both
 * processes is used to carry the data. RPC calls are used to synchronize the
 * access to the buffer. When the client performs an RPC, it hands over the
 * responsibility to access the buffer to the server. While an RPC is in
 * progress and the client blocks for the reply, the server may read and write
 * the buffer. At all other times, the server is not expected to access the
 * buffer.
 *
 * This hand over of the buffer between both parties is a mere convention. It
 * is not enforced by the system. For this reason, neither of both proceess
 * must keep its internal state stored in the buffer. Data should always be
 * copied in/out and never processed directly in the buffer.
