This repository contains device drivers ported from OpenBSD.

Audio
#####

The audio driver is ported from OpenBSD 5.7 and includes support for
Intel HD Audio as well as for Ensoniq AudioPCI (ES1370) compatible
soundcards. The HDA driver works on real hardware and Virtualbox
whereas the ES1370 driver is only used in Qemu.


Usage
=====

You have to prepare the contrib sources for this repository by
executing _./tool/ports/prepare_port dde_bsd_. Also you need to make
sure to add the 'dde_bsd' repository to the REPOSITORIES variable
in your 'etc/build.conf'.


Example
=======

The driver can be tested by executing the run script 'run/audio_out.run'.
This example plays a sample file in a loop. The file format is header less
two channel float 32 at 44100 Hz. You may use the 'sox' utility to create
these audio files:

! sox -c 2 -r 44100 foo.wav foo.f32
