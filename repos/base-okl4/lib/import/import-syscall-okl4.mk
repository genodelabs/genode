# Make sure that symlink modification times are handled correctly.
# Otherwise, the creation of symlinks that depend on their own directory
# behaves like a phony rule. This is because the directory mtime is
# determined by taking the mtimes of containing symlinks into account.
# Hence, all symlinks (except for the youngest) depend on a directory
# with a newer mtime. The make flag -L fixes the problem. Alternatively,
# we could use 'cp' instead of 'ln'.
