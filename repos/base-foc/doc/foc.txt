Fiasco.OC is a microkernel developed by the OS group of the TU-Dresden. It's
an object-oriented capability-based system for x86, ARM and PowerPC platforms.

This document provides brief instructions about downloading, building and
booting the Fiasco.OC version of Genode.


Prerequisites
#############

You need certain tools to use the Fiasco.OC build system. On Debian/Ubuntu
systems you have to install the following packages:

! apt-get install make gawk pkg-config subversion patch

Moreover, you need to download and install the tool-chain used by Genode. Have
a look at this page:

:[http://genode.org/download/tool-chain]:
  Genode tool-chain

If you want to use the so called run-scripts in Genode, a mechanism that
automates building, integration and testing of components, you have to install
the following, additional package:

! apt-get install expect


Building the Fiasco.OC version of Genode
########################################

The current version of Genode is available at the public subversion repository:

:http://genode.org/download/subversion-repository:
  Information about accessing the Genode public subversion repository

After you've fetched the Genode source tree from the subversion repository, or
downloaded the latest release tar archive, you need the Fiasco.OC source code,
its kernel-bindings, additional bootstrap tools etc. To simplify that step,
you can use the 'prepare_port' tool:

! ./tool/ports/prepare_port foc

This will install all necessary third-party source code in the 'contrib' folder.

For the vesa driver on x86 the x86emu library is required and can be downloaded
and prepared by invoking the following command:

! ./tool/ports/prepare_port x86emu

Now, go to a directory where you want the Genode/Fiasco.OC build directory to
remain. Use the helper script in the 'tool' directory of the Genode
source tree to create the initial build environment. You need to state the
build directory you want to create, and the hardware architecture to run
Fiasco.OC/Genode on. Choose 'foc_x86_32', 'foc_x86_64', or 'foc_pbxa9'
depending on whether you want to build for the 32-bit or 64-bit X86
architecture, or for ARMs Cortex-A9.

! <genode-dir>/tool/create_builddir foc_x86_32 \
!     BUILD_DIR=<build-dir>

Now, go to the newly created build directory and type make:

! cd <build-dir>
! make

This will build the Fiasco.OC kernel, its bootstrap code, and every Genode component,
that runs on top of Fiasco.OC.

If you just want to give Genode/Fiasco.OC a try, you can call e.g.: the demo run-script
instead of building everything:

! cd <build-dir>
! make run/demo
