/*
 * \brief  Mapping of Genode's capability names to kernel capabilities.
 * \author Stefan Kalkowski
 * \date   2012-02-16
 *
 * Although kernels like Fiasco.OC and NOVA provide capability mechanisms
 * to us, which should prevent the usage of global names, there is no
 * efficient way to retrieve a capability a process owns, when it gets the
 * same capability delivered again via IPC from another thread. But in some
 * use-cases in Genode this is essential (e.g. parent getting a close-session
 * request from a child). Moreover, we waste a lot of slots in the
 * capability-space of the process for one and the same kernel-object.
 * That's why we introduce a map of Genode's global capability names to the
 * process-local addresses in the capability-space.
 *
 * TODO: should be moved to the generic part of the framework, and used by
 *       NOVA too.
