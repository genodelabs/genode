This driver is for Intel i915 compatible graphic cards.

Default behaviour
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When no configuration is provided to the driver, it will switch on all devices
connected to the graphics card. It will use the highest resolution as
provided by the BIOS or EDID information from the display devices for each
connector. The virtual resolution delivered to the client is the maximum in
width and height of the active connectors.

When newly connected devices are detected by the hardware, the new connectors
are enabled, probed, and again the highest resolution across all active
connectors will be chosen. By default, the current config of the driver will
be re-read and re-applied. This behaviour can be disabled by

! <config apply_on_hotplug="no"/>

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each of the connectors can be configured explicitly in terms of resolution and
whether it should be enabled or not. This looks like the following:

! <config>
!   <connector name="eDP-1" width="1920" height="1080" hz="60" brightness="75" enabled="true"/>
!   <connector name="DP-1"  mode_id="2" enabled="true"/>
! </config>

The resolution can be configured exactly by the reported mode_id or by
the width/height/hz attributes. In the latter case the driver will take the
first matching mode out of multiple matching modes potentially.

When the configuration changes during runtime, the driver will adapt to it. In
this case, it will also change the current virtual resolution to the maximum of
the configured resolutions in width and height, and it will inform its client
about the change in resolution.

The brightness value is in percent and takes effect only if supported by
the hardware.

The maximal physical resolution can be enforced by:

! <config max_width="2560" max_height="1440">
! </config>

The virtual resolution can be enforced by:

! <config force_width="1024" force_height="768">
! </config>

To present all available connectors and their possible resolutions to the user,
the driver is able to deliver a corresponding report, which can be enabled
in the configuration as follows:

! <config>
!   <report connectors="yes"/>
! </config>

The exported report has the following format:

! <connectors>
!   <connector name="eDP-1" connected="true" brightness="50">
!     <mode width="1920" height="1080" hz="60" mode_id="1" preferred="true"/>
!     ...
!   </connector>
!   <connector name="DP-1" connected="true">
!     <mode width="1920" height="1200" hz="60" mode_id="1" preferred="true"/>
!     <mode width="1920" height="1080" hz="60" mode_id="2"/>
!     <mode width="1280" height="1024" hz="60" mode_id="3"/>
!     <mode width="1024" height="768"  hz="60" mode_id="4"/>
!     ...
!   </connector>
!   <connector name="HDMI-A-1" connected="false"/>
! </connectors>

The brightness attribute is reported only if the hardware supports it.
