This driver is for Intel i915 compatible graphic cards.

Default behaviour
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When no configuration is provided to the driver, it will switch on all devices
connected to the graphics card. It will use the best resolution as
provided by the BIOS or EDID information from the display devices for each
connector. The virtual resolution delivered to the client is the maximum in
width and height of the different connectors. The framebuffer memory is
directly exported to the client of the driver. When newly connected devices are
detected by the hardware, the new connectors are enabled, probed, and again the
'best' resolution will be chosen for the device. Nevertheless, it won't have an
effect on the virtual resolution.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each of the connectors can be configured explicitly in terms of resolution and
whether it should be enabled or not. This looks like the following:

! <config>
!   <connector name="LVDS-11" width="1280" height="800" hz="60" brightness="75" enabled="true"/>
! </config>

When the configuration changes during runtime, the driver will adapt to it. In
this case, it will also change the current virtual resolution to the maximum of
the configured resolutions in width and height, and it will inform its client
about the change in resolution.

The brightness value is in percent and takes effect only if supported by
the hardware.

The virtual resolution can be enforced by:

! <config force_width="1024" force_height="768">
! </config>

To present all available connectors and their possible resolutions to the user,
the driver is able to deliver a corresponding report, which can be enabled
in the configuration as follows:

! <config>
!   <report connectors="yes"/>
! </config>

The exported report has the following format:

! <connectors>
!   <connector name="LVDS-11" connected="1" brightness="50">
!     <mode width="1280" height="800" hz="60"/>
!     ...
!   </connector>
!   <connector name="HDMI-A-1" connected="false"/>
!   <connector name="DP-1" connected="false"/>
! </connectors>

The brightness attribute is reported only if the hardware supports it.
