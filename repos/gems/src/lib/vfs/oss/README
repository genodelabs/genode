The VFS OSS plugin offers access to Genode's Record and Play sessions by
providing a file-system that can be mounted at arbitrary location within the
VFS of a component. It exposes a data file that can be used as 'dsp' file,
e.g., _/dev/dsp_ as is common with OSS. The support I/O control operations or
rather the properties of the pseudo-device are provided in form of a structured
'info' file located in the directory named after the data file, e.g.,
_/dev/.dsp/info_.

This file may by used to query the configured parameters and has the following
structure:

! <oss channels="2" format="16" sample_rate="44100" ifrag_total="430"
!      ifrag_size="2048" ifrag_avail="0" ifrag_bytes="0" ofrag_total="254"
!      ofrag_size="2048" ofrag_avail="254" ofrag_bytes="520192" optr_samples="0"
!      optr_fifo_samples="0" play_underruns="0"/>

Each parameter can also be accessed via its own file. The following list
presents all files:

  * :channels (ro): number of available channels. Set to 2 (stereo).
    Corresponding OSS commands: 'SNDCTL_DSP_CHANNELS'

  * :format (ro): sample format, e.g. s16le. Defaults to AFMT_S16_LE.
    Corresponding OSS commands: 'SNDCTL_DSP_SAMPLESIZE'

  * :sample_rate (ro): sample rate of the underlying Audio_out session.
    Corresponding OSS commands: 'SNDCTL_DSP_SPEED'

  * :ifrag_total (rw): total number of input fragments. Set to number of
    packets in the underlying Audio_in session's packet-stream by default.
    Corresponding OSS commands: 'SNDCTL_DSP_SETFRAGMENT',
    'SNDCTL_DSP_GETISPACE'

  * :ifrag_size (rw): size of an input fragment. Set to 2048 (number of
    channels times size of Audio_in period times size of s16le sample) by
    default.
    Corresponding OSS commands: 'SNDCTL_DSP_SETFRAGMENT',
    'SNDCTL_DSP_GETISPACE'

  * :ifrag_avail (ro): number of available input fragments. Initially set to 0.
    Corresponding OSS commands: 'SNDCTL_DSP_GETISPACE'

  * :ifrag_bytes (ro): number of available input bytes. Initially set to 0.
    Corresponding OSS commands: 'SNDCTL_DSP_GETISPACE'

  * :enable_input (rw): writing 1 or 0 into this file enables or disables
    input processing.
    Corresponding OSS commands: SNDCTL_DSP_SETTRIGGER

  * :halt_input (wo): writing anything into this file halts input processing.
    Corresponding OSS commands: SNDCTL_DSP_HALT

  * :ofrag_total (rw): total number of output fragments. Set to number of
    packets in the underlying Audio_out session's packet-stream by default.
    Corresponding OSS commands: 'SNDCTL_DSP_SETFRAGMENT',
    'SNDCTL_DSP_GETOSPACE'

  * :ofrag_size (rw): size of an output fragment. Set to 2048 (number of
    channels times size of Audio_out period times size of s16le sample) by
    default.
    Corresponding OSS commands: 'SNDCTL_DSP_SETFRAGMENT',
    'SNDCTL_DSP_GETOSPACE'

  * :ofrag_avail (ro): number of available output fragments. Initially set to
    total fragment count.
    Corresponding OSS commands: 'SNDCTL_DSP_GETOSPACE'

  * :ofrag_bytes (ro): number of available output bytes. Initially set to
    total count buffer space.
    Corresponding OSS commands: 'SNDCTL_DSP_GETOSPACE'

  * :optr_samples (ro): total number of samples enqueued in the Play session
    Corresponding OSS commands: 'SNDCTL_DSP_CURRENT_OPTR'

  * :optr_fifo_samples (ro): number of samples residing in the internal output
    buffer
    Corresponding OSS commands: 'SNDCTL_DSP_CURRENT_OPTR'

  * :play_underruns (rw): number of detected underrun errors, Writing anything
    into this file resets the value to zero 
    Corresponding OSS commands: 'SNDCTL_DSP_GETERROR'

  * :enable_output (rw): writing 1 or 0 into this file enables or disables
    output processing.
    Corresponding OSS commands: SNDCTL_DSP_SETTRIGGER

  * :halt_output (wo): writing anything into this file halts output processing.
    Corresponding OSS commands: SNDCTL_DSP_HALT

In its current state the plugin is merely enough to use simple applications
requiring nothing more than a minimal set of the OSSv4 API. It does not allow
altering of all parameters and will only work when 44100Hz/s16le is used.

The following '<oss_next>' attributes can be used to alter the behaviour of
the plugin:

  * :verbose: if set to 'true' diagnostic message will be printed to the log,
    it defaults to 'false'

  * :max_ofrag_size: sets the maximal allowed output fragment size, defaults
    to 8192 that correspondes to 2048 samples (~46,4 ms) at stereo 44.1 kHz

  * :min_ofrag_size: sets the minimal allowed output fragment size, defaults
    to 2048 that correspondes to 512 samples (~11,6 ms) at stereo 44.1 kHz

  * :max_ifrag_size: sets the maximal allowed input fragment size, defaults
    to 8192 that correspondes to 2048 samples (~46,4 ms) at stereo 44.1 kHz

  * :min_ifrag_size: sets the minimal allowed input fragment size, defaults
    to 2048 that correspondes to 512 samples (~11,6 ms) at stereo 44.1 kHz


The following config snippet illustrates its configuration:
