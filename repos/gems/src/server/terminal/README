This is a graphical terminal implementation. It provides the Terminal
service and uses a nitpicker session for screen representation.


Color configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default color palette can be configured via the <palette> XML
configuration node like follows. There are 16 colors configurable -
index 0-7 normal color and index 8-15 bright (bold) colors.

! <config>
!   <palette>
!     <color index="0" value="#000000"/> <!-- black is real black -->
!     <color index="8" value="#101010"/> <!-- bright black stands out a bit -->
!   </palette>
! ...
! </config>


Clipboard support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the '<config>' attribute 'copy="yes"' specified, the terminal allows
the user to select text to be reported to a "clipboard" report. The selection
mode is activated by holding the left shift key. While the selection mode
is active, the text position under mouse pointer is highlighted and the
user can select text via the left mouse button. Upon release of the mouse
button, the selection is reported.

Vice versa, with the '<config>' attribute 'paste="yes"' specified, the
terminal allows the user to paste the content of a "clipboard" ROM session
to the terminal client by pressing the middle mouse button.
