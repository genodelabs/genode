:Warning:

Although in principal functioning, the WireGuard port has not been exposed to a
sufficient amount of real-world testing, so far. Therefore, we strongly
recommend not to use it in any security-critical scenarios! There is no
guarantee that the port meets any of the security goals pursued by the
WireGuard protocol or other WireGuard implementations!
