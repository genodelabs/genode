                               USB NIC driver


Driver for network-interface cards and LTE modems with MBIM support connected via USB.


Current supported devices
=========================

* NICs containing an AX88179A chip
* NICs that support the NCM profile (e.g., RTL8156)
* NICs that the ECM profile
* LTE modems that support the MBIM configuration


NIC configuration
=================

Configuration snippet:

!<start name="usb_net">
!  <resource name="RAM" quantum="10M"/>
!  <config mac="2e:60:90:0c:4e:01 configuration="2" />
!  <route>
!    <service name="Uplink"><child name="nic_router"/></service/>
!    ....
!  </route>
!</start>

The driver connects as an Uplink client to Genode's network infrastructure.

The 'mac' can be used to configure the hardware address on devices that support
setting it and for devices that do not offer a hardware address (a random
address will be used otherwise).

The 'configuration' attribute allows for setting the desired configuration
profile of the USB device in case there is more than one profile. In case it is
omitted or 0, the driver will choose a profile (first non-vendor specific).


LTE modem configuration
========================

Currently there is support for MBIM (Mobile Broadband Interface Model) devices.

Tested devices:
Huawai ME906s      (P/V: 12d1:15c1) - "configuration=3" for 'usb_net'
Fibocom L830-EB-00 (P/V: 2cb7:0210) - automatically detected


!<start name="usb_nic">
!  <resource name="RAM" quantum="10M"/>
!  <provides>
!    <service name="Terminal"/>
!  </provides>
!  <config mac="02:00:00:00:01:01" configuration="3"/>
!  <route>
!    <service name="Uplink"><child name="nic_router"/></service/>
!    ....
!  </route>
!</start>


In case the driver finds a MBIM capable device it will announce a terminal
session which is used as the control channel (wireless communication device
class - CDC WDM).

An example scenario can be found in Genode World
(_src/app/mbimcli_). Once a data connection is established via the Terminal
session, the Uplink session is used to transfer Ethernet frames.
