Device drivers ported from the Linux kernel

USB
###

Controller configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The driver can be started using different or all USB controller types a platform
offers (USB 1.0/2.0/3.0). Note that not all controllers are supported by all
platforms.  Controllers can be enabled as attribute in the config node of the
driver.  Supported attributes are: 'uhci', 'ehci', and 'xhci'.


Configuration snippet to enable UHCI and EHCI

! <config uhci="yes" ehci="yes">

HID
~~~

Supports keyboard and mouse. A run script can be found under 'run/usb_hid.run'.

Configuration snippet:

!<start name="usb_drv">
!  <resource name="RAM" quantum="3M"/>
!  <provides><service name="Input"/></provides>
!  <config uhci="yes" ehci="yes" xhci="yes">
!    <hid/>
!  </config>
!</start>

Note: It has been observed that certain 1.0 versions of Qemu do not generate
mouse interrupts. The mouse driver should work correctly on Qemu 1.0.93 and
above.

HID - Touchscreen support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Touchscreen absolute coordinates must be calibrated (e.g. re-calculated) to
screen absolute coordinates. The screen resolution is not determined
automatically by the USB driver, but can be configured as sub node of the
hid xml tag:

!...
!<hid>
!  <touchscreen width="1024" height="768" multitouch="no"/>
!<hid/>
!...

If a touchscreen is multi-touch-capable than the multitouch attribute gears
which type of Genode input events are generated. If set to  'no' (default)
than absolute events are generated and no multitouch events. If set to 'yes'
solely multitouch events are generated.

Storage
~~~~~~~

Currently supports one USB storage device. Hot plugging has not been tested. A
run script can be found under 'run/usb_storage.run'.

Configuration snippet:

!<start name="usb_drv">
!  <resource name="RAM" quantum="2M"/>
!  <provides> <service name="Block"/> </provides>
!  <config><storage /></config>
!</start uhci="yes">


Network (Nic)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configuration snippet:

!<start name="usb_drv">
!  <resource name="RAM" quantum="3M"/>
!  <provides>
!    <service name="Nic"/>
!    <service name="Input"/>
!  </provides>
!  <config ehci="yes" xhci="yes">
!    <nic mac="2e:60:90:0c:4e:01" />
!    <hid/>
!  </config>
!</start>

Please observe that this setup starts the HID and Nic service at the same time.
Also there is the 'mac' attribute where one can specify the hardware address of
the network interface. This is necessary in case the EEPROM of the network card
cannot be accessed via the host controller making it impossible to retrieve the
devices hardware address. If this is the case and no 'mac' attribute is given a
fallback address will be assigned to the network device. Note that the fallback
address will always be the same.

LXIP
####

LXIP is a port of the Linux TCP/IP stack to Genode. It is build as a shared
library named 'lxip.lib.so'. The IP stack can be interfaced using Genode's
version of 'libc' by linking your application to 'lxip_libc' plugin in your
'target.mk' file.

WIFI
####

The wifi_drv component is a port of the Linux mac802.11 stack, including the
iwlwifi driver as well as libnl and wpa_supplicant, to Genode.

Configuration snippet:

!<start name="wifi_drv">
!  <resource name="RAM" quantum="32M"/>
!  <provides><service name="Nic"/></provides>
!  <config>
!    <libc stdout="/dev/log" stderr="/dev/log" rtc="/dev/rtc">
!      <vfs>
!        <dir name="dev"> <log/> <rtc/>
!           <jitterentropy name="random"/>
!           <jitterentropy name="urandom"/>
!        </dir>
!        <inline name="wpa_supplicant.conf">
!network={
!  id_str="foobar"
!  ssid="foobar"
!  key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
!  psk="foobarfoobar"
!}
!        </inline>
!      </vfs>
!    </libc>
!  </config>
!  <route>
!    <service name="Rtc"> <any-child /> </service>
!    <any-service> <parent/> <any-child /> </any-service>
!  </route>
!</start

The wifi_drv creates two distinct reports to communicate its state and
information about the wireless infrastructure to other components. The
first one is a list of all available accesspoints. The following examplary
report shows its structure:

!<wlan_accesspoints>
!  <accesspoint ssid="skynet" bssid="00:01:02:03:04:05" quality="40"/>
!  <accesspoint ssid="foobar" bssid="01:02:03:04:05:06" quality="70" protection="WPA-PSK"/>
!  <accesspoint ssid="foobar" bssid="01:02:03:04:05:07" quality="10" protection="WPA-PSK"/>
!</wlan_accesspoints>

Each accesspoint node has attributes that contain the SSID and the BSSID
of the accesspoint as well as the link quality (signal strength). These
attributes are mandatory. If the network is protected, the node will also
have an attribute describing the type of protection in addition.

The second report provides information about the state of the connection
to the currently connected accesspoint:

!<wlan_state>
!  <accesspoint ssid="foobar" bssid="01:02:03:04:05:06" quality="70" protection="WPA-PSK" state="connected"/>
!</wlan_state>

Valid state values are 'connected', 'disconnected', 'connecting' and
'disconnecting'.

In return, the wifi_drv get its configuration via a ROM module. This ROM
module contains the selected accesspoint. To connect to a accesspoint
a report like the following is used:

!<selected_accesspoint ssid="foobar" bssid="01:02:03:04:05:06" protection="WPA-PSK" psk="foobar123!"/>

To disconnect from an accesspoint, a empty report is sent:

!<selected_accesspoint/>

By subscribing to both reports and providing the required ROM module, a
component can control the wireless driver. An example therefore is the Qt
based component in 'src/app/qt_wifi_connect'.

Currently only WPA/WPA2 protection using a pre-shared key is supported.

RAW
~~~

Allows raw access to USB devices via the 'Usb' session interface.

Configuration snippet:

!<start name="usb_drv">
!  <resource name="RAM" quantum="8M"/>
!  <provides><service name="Usb"/></provides>
!  <config uhci="yes" ehci="yes" xhci="yes">
!    <raw>
!        <report devices="yes"/>
!    </raw>
!  </config>
!</start>

The optional 'devices' report lists the connected devices and gets updated when devices are added or removed.

Example report:

<devices>
    <device vendor_id="0x17ef" product_id="0x4816"/>
    <device vendor_id="0x0a5c" product_id="0x217f"/>
    <device vendor_id="0x8087" product_id="0x0020"/>
    <device vendor_id="0x8087" product_id="0x0020"/>
    <device vendor_id="0x1d6b" product_id="0x0002"/>
    <device vendor_id="0x1d6b" product_id="0x0002"/>
</devices>

There is no distinction yet for multiple devices of the same type.
