This is the generic Genode base system, which consists of two parts:

:_Core_: is the root of the Genode component tree. It provides abstractions for
  the lowest-level hardware resources such as RAM, ROM, CPU, and device access.
  All generic parts of core can be found here. For kernel-specific parts,
  refer to the appropriate 'base-<kernel>' directory.

:_Base libraries and interfaces: that are used by each Genode component
  to interact with other components. This is the glue that holds everything
  together.

Depending on the used kernel, core may export information about the hardware
platform as a ROM called 'platform_info'. For example, if the ACPI RSDT and
XSDT physical pointer are reported by the used kernel and/or bootloader, core
provides this information in the ROM as follows.

!<platform_info>
! <acpi revision="2" rsdt="0x1fe93074" xsdt="0x1fe930e8"/>
! <boot>
!   <framebuffer phys="0x7300000" width="1024" height="768" bpp="32"/>
! </boot>
!</platform_info>

If the graphics device is initialised and can be directly used by a
framebuffer driver, core provides the physical pointer to the framebuffer, the
resolution, and color depth in bits.
