/**
 * Signal
 *
 * A signal represents a number of asynchronous notifications produced by
 * one transmitter. If notifications are generated at a higher rate than as
 * they can be processed at the receiver, the transmitter counts the
 * notifications and delivers the total amount with the next signal
 * transmission. This way, the total number of notifications gets properly
 * communicated to the receiver even if the receiver is not highly
 * responsive.
 *
 * Asynchronous notifications do not carry any payload because this payload
 * would need to be queued at the transmitter. However, each transmitter
 * imprints a signal-context reference into each signal. This context
 * can be used by the receiver to distinguish signals coming from different
 * transmitters.
