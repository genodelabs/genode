/**
 * Delete operator invoked when an exception occurs during the construction of
 * a dynamically allocated object
 *
 * When an exception occurs during the construction of a dynamically allocated
 * object, the C++ standard devises the automatic invocation of the global
 * operator delete. When passing an allocator as argument to the new operator
 * (the typical case for Genode), the compiler magically calls the operator
 * delete taking the allocator type as second argument. This is how we end up
 * here.
 *
 * There is one problem though: We get the pointer of the to-be-deleted object
 * but not its size. But Genode's 'Allocator' interface requires the object
 * size to be passed as argument to 'Allocator::free()'.
 *
 * Even though in the general case, we cannot assume all 'Allocator'
 * implementations to remember the size of each allocated object, the commonly
 * used 'Heap', 'Sliced_heap', 'Allocator_avl', and 'Slab' do so and ignore the
 * size argument. When using either of those allocators, we are fine. Otherwise
 * we print a warning and pass the zero size argument anyway.
 *
 * :Warning: Never use an allocator that depends on the size argument of the
 *   'free()' method for the allocation of objects that may throw exceptions
 *   at their construction time!

 * delete expression, we mimic the expression by using this template

 * operator delete afterwards.
