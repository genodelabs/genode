 * a temporary copy of all arguments that have a reference type and use a
 * reference to this copy instead of the original within this function.
 *
 * There is a slight difference between the object that is constructed by this
 * function and a common object of the given type. If the destructor of the
 * given type or of any base of the given type is virtual, the vtable of the
 * returned object references an empty delete(void *) operator for that
 * destructor. However, this shouldn't be a problem as an object constructed by
 * this function should never get destructed implicitely or through a delete
 * expression.
