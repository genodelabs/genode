		 * accordingly. However, this upgrade, in turn, may result in the
		 * depletion of the process' RAM quota. In this case, the process would
		 * issue a resource request to the parent. But in order to do so, the
		 * fallback signal handler has to be constructed. To solve this
		 * hen-and-egg problem, we allocate a so-called emergency RAM reserve
		 * immediately at the startup of the process as part of the
		 * 'Platform_env'. When initializing the fallback signal handler, these
		 * resources get released in order to ensure an eventual upgrade of the
		 * signal session to succeed.
		 *
		 * The corner case is tested by 'os/src/test/resource_request'.
