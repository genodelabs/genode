	 * with half-working exception handling cause subtle failures that are hard
	 * to interpret.
	 *
	 * Second, the C++ support library allocates data structures lazily on the
	 * first occurrence of an exception. This allocation traverses into
	 * Genode's heap and, in some corner cases, consumes several KB of stack.
	 * This is usually not a problem when the first exception is triggered from
	 * the main thread but it becomes an issue when the first exception is
	 * thrown from the stack of a thread with a specially tailored (and
	 * otherwise sufficient) stack size. By throwing an exception here, we
	 * mitigate this issue by eagerly performing those allocations.
