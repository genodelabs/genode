 * The 'delete (void *)' operator gets referenced by compiler generated code,
 * so it must be publicly defined in the 'cxx' library. These compiler
 * generated calls seem to get executed only subsequently to explicit
 * 'delete (void *)' calls in application code, which are not supported by the
 * 'cxx' library, so the 'delete (void *)' implementation in the 'cxx' library
 * does not have to do anything. Applications should use the 'delete (void *)'
 * implementation of the 'stdcxx' library instead. To make this possible, the
 * 'delete (void *)' implementation in the 'cxx' library must be 'weak'.
