/*
 * \brief  Stack layout and organization
 * \author Norman Feske
 * \date   2006-04-28
 *
 * For storing thread-specific data such as the stack and thread-local data,
 * there is a dedicated portion of the virtual address space. This portion is
 * called stack area. Within this area, each thread has
 * a fixed-sized slot. The layout of each slot looks as follows
 *
 * ; lower address
 * ;   ...
 * ;   ============================ <- aligned at the slot size
 * ;
 * ;             empty
 * ;
 * ;   ----------------------------
 * ;
 * ;             stack
 * ;             (top)              <- initial stack pointer
 * ;   ---------------------------- <- address of 'Stack' object
 * ;       thread-specific data
 * ;   ----------------------------
 * ;              UTCB
 * ;   ============================ <- aligned at the slot size
 * ;   ...
 * ; higher address
 *
 * On some platforms, a user-level thread-control block (UTCB) contains
 * data shared between the user-level thread and the kernel. It is typically
 * used for transferring IPC message payload or for system-call arguments.
 * The additional stack members are a reference to the corresponding
 * 'Thread' object and the name of the thread.
 *
 * The stack area is a virtual memory area, initially not backed by real
 * memory. When a new thread is created, an empty slot gets assigned to the new
 * thread and populated with memory pages for the stack and thread-specific
 * data. Note that this memory is allocated from the RAM session of the
 * component environment and not accounted for when using the 'sizeof()'
 * operand on a 'Thread' object.
 *
 * A thread may be associated with more than one stack. Additional secondary
 * stacks can be associated with a thread, and used for user level scheduling.
