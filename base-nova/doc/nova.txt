When we started the development of Genode in 2006 at the OS Group of the TU
Dresden, it was originally designated to be the user land of a next-generation
and to-be-developed new kernel called NOVA. Because the kernel was not ready at
that time, we had to rely on intermediate solutions as kernel platform such as
L4/Fiasco and Linux during development. These circumstances led us to the
extremely portable design that Genode has today and motivated us to make Genode
available on the whole family of L4 microkernels. In December 2009, the day we
waited for a long time had come. The first version of NOVA was publicly
released:

Besides the novel and modern kernel interface, NOVA has a list of features that
sets it apart from most other microkernels, in particular support for
virtualization hardware, multi-processor support, and capability-based
security.


Why bringing Genode to NOVA?
############################

NOVA is an acronym for NOVA OS Virtualization Architecture. It stands for a
radically new approach of combining full x86 virtualization with microkernel
design principles. Because NOVA is a microkernelized hypervisor, the term
microhypervisor was coined. In its current form, it successfully addresses
three main challenges. First, how to consolidate a microkernel system-call API
with a hypercall API in such a way that the API remains orthogonal? The answer
to this question lies in NOVA's unique IPC interface. Second, how to implement
a virtual machine monitor outside the hypervisor without spoiling
performance? The Vancouver virtual machine monitor that runs on top NOVA proves
that a decomposition at this system level is not only feasible but can yield
high performance. Third, being a modern microkernel, NOVA set out to pursue a
capability-based security model, which is a challenge on its own.

Up to now, the NOVA developers were most concerned about optimizing and
evaluating NOVA for the execution of virtual machines, not so much about
running a fine-grained decomposed multi-server operating system. This is where
Genode comes into play. With our port of Genode to NOVA, we contribute the
workload to evaluate NOVA's kernel API against this use case. We are happy to
report that the results so far are overly positive.

At this point, we want to thank the main developers of NOVA Udo Steinberg and
Bernhard Kauer for making their exceptional work and documentation publicly
available, and for being so responsive to our questions. We also greatly
enjoyed the technical discussions we had and look forward to the future
evolution of NOVA.


How to explore Genode on NOVA?
##############################

To download the NOVA kernel and integrate it with Genode, issue the following
command from within the 'base-nova' directory:

! make prepare

For the vesa driver on x86 the x86emu library is required and can be downloaded
and prepared by invoking the following command from within the 'libports'
directory:

! make prepare PKG=x86emu

For creating a preconfigured build directory prepared for compiling Genode for
NOVA, use the 'create_builddir' tool:

! <genode-dir>/tool/create_builddir nova_x86_32 BUILD_DIR=<build-dir>

This tool will create a fresh build directory at the location specified
as 'BUILD_DIR'. Provided that you have installed the
[http://genode.org/download/tool-chain - Genode tool chain], you can now build
the NOVA kernel via

! make kernel

For test driving Genode on NOVA directly from the build directory, you can use
Genode's run mechanism. For example, the following command builds and executes
Genode's graphical demo scenario on Qemu:

! make run/demo


Challenges
##########

From all currently supported base platforms of Genode, the port to NOVA was
the most venturesome effort. It is the first platform with kernel support for
capabilities and local names. That means no process except the kernel has
global knowledge. This raises a number of questions that seem extremely hard
to solve at the first sight. For example: There are no global IDs for threads
and other kernel objects. So how to address the destination for an IPC message?
Or another example: A thread does not know its own identity per se and there is
no system call similar to 'getpid' or 'l4_myself', not even a way to get a
pointer to a thread's own user-level thread-control block (UTCB). The UTCB,
however, is needed to invoke system calls. So how can a thread obtain its UTCB
in order to use system calls? The answers to these questions must be provided by
user-level concepts. Fortunately, Genode was designed for a capability kernel
right from the beginning so that we already had solutions to most of these
questions. In the following, we give a brief summary of the specifics of Genode
on NOVA:

* We maintain our own system-call bindings for NOVA ('base-nova/include/nova/')
  derived from the NOVA specification. We put the bindings under MIT license
  to encourage their use outside of Genode.

* Core runs directly as roottask on the NOVA hypervisor. On startup, core
  maps the complete I/O port range to itself and implements debug output via
  comport 0.

* Because NOVA does not allow rootask to have a BSS segment, we need a slightly
  modified linker script for core (see 'src/platform/roottask.ld').
  All other Genode programs use Genode's generic linker script.

* The Genode 'Capability' type consists of a portal selector expressing the
  destination of a capability invocation.

* Thread-local data such as the UTCB pointer is provided by the new thread
  context management introduced with the Genode release 10.02. It enables
  each thread to determine its thread-local data using the current stack
  pointer.

* NOVA provides threads without time called local execution contexts (EC).
  Local ECs are used as server-side RPC handlers. The processing time
  needed to perform RPC requests is provided by the client during the RPC call.
  This way, RPC semantics becomes very similar to function call semantics with
  regard to the accounting of CPU time. Genode already distinguishes normal
  threads (with CPU time) and server-side RPC handlers ('Server_activation')
  and, therefore, can fully utilize this elegant mechanism without changing the
  Genode API.

* On NOVA, there are no IPC send or IPC receive operations. Hence, this part
  of Genode's IPC framework cannot be implemented on NOVA. However, the
  corresponding classes 'Ipc_istream' and 'Ipc_ostream' are never used directly
  but only as building blocks for the actually used 'Ipc_client' and
  'Ipc_server' classes. Compared with the other Genode base platforms, Genode's
  API for synchronous IPC communication maps more directly onto the NOVA
  system-call interface.

* The Lock implementation utilizes NOVA's semaphore as a utility to let a
  thread block in the attempt to get a contended lock. In contrast to the
  intuitive way of using one kernel semaphore for each user lock, we use only
  one kernel semaphore per thread and the peer-to-peer wake-up mechanism we
  introduced in the release 9.08. This has two advantages: First, a lock does
  not consume a kernel resource, and second, the full semantics of the Genode
  lock including the 'cancel-blocking' semantics are preserved.

* NOVA does not support server-side out-of-order processing of RPC requests.
  This is particularly problematic in three cases: Page-fault handling, signal
  delivery, and the timer service.

  A page-fault handler can receive a page fault request only if the previous
  page fault has been answered. However, if there is no answer for a
  page-fault, the page-fault handler has to decide whether to reply with a
  dummy answer (in this case, the faulter will immediately raise the same page
  fault again) or block until the page-fault can be resolved. But in the latter
  case, the page-fault handler cannot handle any other page faults. This is
  unfeasible if there is only one page-fault handler in the system. Therefore,
  we instantiate one pager per user thread.  This way, we can block and unblock
  individual threads when faulting.

  Another classical use case for out-of-order RPC processing is signal
  delivery. Each process has a signal-receiver thread that blocks at core's
  signal service using an RPC call. This way, core can selectively deliver
  signals by replying to one of these in-flight RPCs with a zero-timeout
  response (preserving the fire-and-forget signal semantics). On NOVA however,
  a server cannot have multiple RPCs in flight. Hence, we use a NOVA semaphore
  shared between core and the signal-receiver thread to wakeup the
  signal-receiver on the occurrence of a signal. Because a semaphore-up
  operation does not carry payload, the signal has to perform a non-blocking
  RPC call to core to pick up the details about the signal. Thanks to Genode's
  RPC framework, the use of the NOVA semaphore is hidden in NOVA-specific stub
  code for the signal interface and remains completely transparent at API
  level.

* Because NOVA provides no time source, we use the x86 PIT as user-level time
  source, similar as on OKL4.

* On the current version of NOVA, kernel capabilities are delegated using IPC.
  Genode supports this scheme by being able to marshal 'Capability' objects as
  RPC message payload. In contrast to all other Genode base platforms where
  the 'Capability' object is just plain data, the NOVA version must marshal
  'Capability' objects such that the kernel translates the sender-local name to
  the receiver-local name. This special treatment is achieved by overloading
  the marshalling and unmarshalling operators of Genode's RPC framework. The
  transfer of capabilities is completely transparent at API level and no
  modification of existing RPC stub code was needed.


Manually booting Genode on NOVA
###############################

NOVA supports multi-boot-compliant boot loaders such as GRUB, Pulsar, or gPXE.
For example, a GRUB configuration entry for booting the Genode demo scenario
with NOVA looks as follows, whereas 'genode/' is a symbolic link to the
'var/run/demo/genode' directory created by invoking the 'demo' run script.

! title Genode demo scenario
!  kernel /hypervisor iommu serial
!  module /genode/core
!  module /genode/config
!  module /genode/init
!  module /genode/timer
!  module /genode/nitpicker
!  module /genode/liquid_fb
!  module /genode/launchpad
!  module /genode/scout
!  module /genode/testnit
!  module /genode/nitlog
!  module /genode/pci_drv
!  module /genode/ps2_drv
!  module /genode/fb_drv

Limitations
###########

The current NOVA version of Genode is able to run the complete Genode demo
scenario including several device drivers (PIT, PS/2, VESA, PCI) and the GUI.
Still the NOVA support is not on par with some of the other platforms.
The current limitations are:

* Threads (ECs) can not be migrated to another CPU once started.

* For portals used as exception vectors for threads, the thread causing the
  exception and the handler thread which is bound to the exception portal must
  be on the same CPU.

* Priorities for Genode threads are not supported.
