                             Road Map
                             ========


Herein, we lay out our plans for evolving Genode. Progress in addition to this
planning will very much depend on the degree of community support the project
will receive. The
[https://genode.org/about/challenges - Challenges] page collects some of our
ideas to advance Genode in various further directions.

The road map is not fixed. If there is commercial interest of pushing the
Genode technology to a certain direction, we are willing to revisit our plans.


Review of 2025
##############

We dedicated the four releases
([https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/25.02 - 25.02],
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/25.05 - 25.05],
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/25.08 - 25.08],
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/25.11 - 25.11])
of the past year to the maxim "rigidity, clarity, performance".

The year got kicked off with SIMD-based graphics optimizations, which
made Genode well usable in multi-monitor and rotated-screen setups.
In terms of code rigidity, we were able to proudly announce the elimination
of C++ exceptions from the base framework by mid of the year. This was made
possible by embracing
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/25.05#Return_values_expressed_via_sum_types - sum types]
as error-propagation technique.
Thanks to this tireless reconstruction work, we have now gained the luxury of
knowing that Genode's base system has left no error condition unconsidered.
Over the course of the year, this new level of rigidity proliferated into the
realms of our custom "base-hw" kernel, the virtualization interface, and a
growing number of further components.

On the account of clarity, the most prominent development has been the
introduction of a new
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/25.08#Consideration_of_a_lean_alternative_to_XML - "human-inclined data"]
(HID) syntax for the configuration and state reporting of components. Besides
crafting the code for parsing, generating, and working with the new format,
the most delicate challenge had been the planning of a smooth migration path
from our time-tested use of XML to the new format. In Autumn, we reported
success in that department by offering a special
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/25.11#Human-inclined_data__HID__processing - flavor of Sculpt OS]
capable of seamlessly using the new format.
Thanks to the experience and feedback gathered while driving this version
day to day with joy, it quickly became clear that there is no going back.

Among the many performance-oriented topics of the year, the results of two
long-term developments stood out: the holistic revision of the
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/25.08#Block-storage_stack_renovations - block-storage]
stack as well as our new
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/25.08#Kernel_scheduling_for_fairness_and_low_latency - CPU scheduler]
specifically designed for fairness and low latency.
Further highlights of 2025 had been the experimental
[https://genodians.org/alex-ab/2025-11-02-sculpt-multi-kernel - multi-kernel]
version of Sculpt OS that gives users the choice between 5 different kernels,
the adoption of the Goa SDK for projects hosted at the community-maintained
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/25.11#Genode-world_using_the_Goa_SDK - Genode-world]
repository, and the frictionless update of all Linux-based device drivers to
Linux 6.12.


2026 - Building bridges
#######################

After a year of pruning and nurturing, it is time again for branching out.
Our annual [https://genode.org/community/mailing-lists - public]
road-map discussion was
[https://lists.genode.org/mailman3/hyperkitty/list/users@lists.genode.org/thread/JMGMUML3KBFEXHJCEZBW5SQURNK7KRZI/ - started]
with the suggestion of "building bridges" as guiding theme for the year.
Bridges to other open-source projects. Bridges to a variety of programming
languages. Bridges to new user demographies. Bridges for the interoperability
of applications.

The suggestion was met with overly positive resonance. Great sympathy with
[https://www.qubes-os.org/ - Qubes OS] was voiced multiple times.
Others highlighted the potential of Genode in headless scenarios at data centers,
servers, or as VM host. When contemplating these directions, the opinionated
Leitzentrale UI of Sculpt OS is not a natural element but may rather stand in
the way. A sensible way for building bridges would make the underlying
architecture and feature set of Sculpt OS useful for Genode-based systems of
different personalities. So this year, we will see the split of Sculpt OS into
reusable parts, thereby opening up a new playground for drawing connections to
other communities and projects.

The move of Genode to the HID format comes with the natural desire to implement
HID parsers for a variety of programming languages. As a matter of honor, those
languages should best become available for Genode in the process. So by the
end of the year, we will have taken HID to languages that we love, and have
taken those languages to Genode.
This ambition goes hand in hand with a stepwise approach towards running the
Goa SDK self-hosted on Genode.

Besides the "bridges" main theme, the schedule sketched below carries forward
several topics of 2025 like IPv6 or improving the flexibility of USB. It also
plans for the update of the arsenal of Linux-based drivers, VirtualBox, the
Chromium engine, and Qt6.
