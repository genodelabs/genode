                 Future Challenges of the Genode project
                 =======================================


Abstract
########

This document compiles various ideas to pursue in the context of Genode. It is
meant as source of inspiration for individuals who are interested in getting
involved with the project and for students who want to base their student
research projects on Genode.


Applications and library infrastructure
#######################################

:Chrome web browser:

  The Chrome web browser promises to address the most pressing security
  concerns of web application by isolation measures, in particular the
  sandboxing of plugins and the confinement of individual web applications. As
  we demonstrated with the Genode Live CD 10.11, Genode facilitates a more
  natural way to pursue such techniques compared with current commodity
  operating systems. Furthermore, the use of Genode as base platform for Chrome
  would strengthen the web-browser security by dwarfing its trusted computing
  base by two orders of magnitude compared to the use of Linux as base
  platform. This would allow Chrome to be considered as a secure interface to
  the web for use cases in the high-assurance domain.

:Qemu or Virtual Box on Genode:

  Using Genode as hosting platform for virtual machines running in Qemu or
  Virtual Box would enable the execution of security-sensitive functions (for
  example cryptography) with a minimally-complex trusted computing base
  beside running Windows on the same machine.

:VNC server implementing Genode's framebuffer session interface:

  With 'Input' and 'Framebuffer', Genode provides two low-level interfaces
  used by interactive applications. For example, the Nitpicker GUI server uses
  these interfaces as a client and, in turn, exports multiple virtual
  'Framebuffer' and 'Input' interfaces to its clients. This enables a
  highly modular use of applications such as the nesting of GUIs. By
  implementing the 'Framebuffer' and 'Input' interfaces with a VNC server
  implementation, all graphical workloads of Genode would become available over
  the network. One immediate application of this implementation is the remote
  testing of graphical Genode applications running on a headless server.

:Tiled window manager:

  At Genode Labs, we pursue the goal to shape Genode into an general-purpose
  operating system suitable for productive work. The feature set needed to
  achieve this goal largely depends on the tools and applications daily used by
  the Genode engineers. As one particularly important tool for being highly
  productive, we identified a tiled user interface. Currently, all developers
  at Genode Labs embrace either the Ion3 window manager or the tiled Terminator
  terminal emulator. Hence, we desire to have a similar mode of user
  interaction on Genode as well. The goal of this challenge is to identify the
  most important usage patters and the implementation of a tiled GUI that
  multiplexes the framebuffer into a set of tiled and tabbed virtual
  framebuffers.

  Related to this work, the low-level 'Framebuffer' and 'Input' interfaces
  should be subject to a revision, for example for enabling the flexible change
  of framebuffer sizes as needed by a tiled user interface.

:Interactive sound switchbox based on Genode's Audio_out session interface:

  Since version 10.05, Genode features a highly flexible configuration concept
  that allows the arbitrary routing of session requests throughout the
  hierarchic process structure. Even though primarily designed for expressing
  mandatory-access control rules, the concept scales far beyond this use case.
  For example, it can be used to run an arbitrary number of processes
  implementing the same interface and connecting the different interface
  implementations. One special case of this scenario is a chain of audio
  filters with each using the 'Audio_out' session interface for both roles
  client and server. Combined with the Nitpicker GUI server and Genode's
  support for real-time priorities, this base techniques enable the creation of
  flexible audio mixer / switchboard applications, which require dedicated
  frameworks (e.g., Jack audio) on traditional operating systems. The goal of
  this project is to create a show case implementation demonstrating the
  feasibility for creating high-quality audio applications on Genode.
  Furthermore, we wish for feedback regarding the current design of our bulk
  streaming interface when used for low-latency applications.

:PDF reader for E-Government use:

  A facility for reading PDF and E-Book documents is one of the indispensable
  features Genode has to provide to be considered for general-purpose
  computing. The goal of this work is to identify a suitable open-source PDF
  engine and port it as native application to Genode. The challenging part is
  to keep the complexity of this application as low as possible in order to
  enable the use of this application as a trusted document reader. Further
  ideas envision the use of PDF files as medium for sensitive documents
  combined with measures for protecting the integrity of the displayed
  information. For example, when processing contracts or similar sensitive
  documents in E-Government scenarios, the consumer of such documents expects
  the correct display of all the information as expressed by the creator of the
  document. In the event of a compromised PDF engine or a man-in-the middle
  attacker manipulating the PDF file, the consumer of the document requires a
  way to identify such security breaches. In this context, running the PDF
  engine in a sandboxed Genode subsystem has two incentives. First, the attack
  surface for manipulating the PDF engine gets dramatically reduced, and
  second, the integrity of the result of the PDF engine can be measured by an
  independent trusted component facilitating Genode secure GUI server
  (Nitpicker).

:Graphical on-target IPC tracing tool using Qt4:

  Analysing the interaction of components of a multi-server operating system
  such as Genode is important to discover bottlenecks of the system and for
  debugging highly complex usage scenarios involving many processes. Currently,
  Genode handles this problem with two approaches. First, Genode's
  recursive structure enables the integration of a subsystem in a basic
  OS setup featuring only those drivers and components used for the particular
  subsystem. After the successful integration of such a subsystem, it can
  be embedded into a far more complex application scenario without any changes.
  With this approach, the subject to analyse can be kept at a reasonable level
  at integration time. For debugging purposes, the current approach is using
  the debugging facilities of the respective base platforms (e.g., using
  GDB on Linux, the Fiasco kernel debugger, the OKL4 kernel debugger).

  However, in many cases, bottlenecks do not occur when integrating individual
  sub systems but after integrating multiple of such subsystems into a large
  application scenario. For such scenarios, existing debugging methodologies do
  not scale. A tool is desired that is able to capture the relationships
  between processes of a potentially large process hierarchy, to display
  communication and control flows between those processes, and to visualize the
  interaction of threads with the kernel's scheduler.

  Since Qt4 is available natively on Genode, the creation of both offline and
  on-target analysis tools has become feasible. The first step of this project
  is creating an interactive on-target tool, that displays the interaction
  of communicating threads as captured on the running system. The tool should
  work on a selected kernel that provides a facility for tracing IPC messages.


Application frameworks
######################

:Running the Meego application stack on Genode using Qt4:

  With Genode 11.02, Qt4 4.7.1 has become available. The most prominent feature
  of this version is the new QML language to design GUIs using a declarative
  language. This technique is targeted specifically to mobile applications and
  other touch-based devices. The goal of this project is to run the Meego
  application stack natively on Genode. First, the software components and
  Meego-specific Linux customizations must be identified. For each such
  component, it must be decided whether to port its code or to reimplement its
  interface. The immediate goal of the first step is running one Meego example
  application natively on Genode.

:Python Qt4 bindings:

  With the Python interpreter and the port of the Qt4 framework, the principle
  components for Python-based GUIs on Genode are available. However, the glue
  between both components is missing. The incentive of this work is supplementing
  our Python port with the modules needed for real applications and porting the
  Qt4 bindings to Genode. This would bring Genode one step closer to executing
  modern Python-based GUI applications (in particular KDE4 applications).

:Evaluation of porting GTK+ to Genode:

  With Qt4, we have demonstrated the feasibility to run a highly-complex
  application framework via Genode on a wide range of microkernels. That leaves
  the question of looking into the other major toolkit in town, namely GTK+ as
  used by Firefox and the Gnome desktop.

:Cairographics:

  Cairo is a high-quality 2D vector graphics engine used by a large number of
  open-source projects, in particular GTK+. Hence the port of Cairo is a
  prerequisite for the GTK+ challenge. In addition, it would enable the
  use of further libraries such as Poppler.


Device drivers
##############

:Enhancing Gallium3D support:

  Genode 10.08 introduced Gallium3D including the GPU driver for Intel GMA
  CPUs. With this initial version, we demonstrated that the powerful software
  stack for running hardware-accelerated 3D applications can be deployed on
  Genode. At the same time, it motivates us to reach out for even more
  ambitious goals:

  First, the current approach executes the GPU driver alongside the complete
  Gallium3D software stack and the application code in one address space. To
  enable the use of multiple hardware-accelerated applications running at the
  same time, the GPU driver must run separated from the Gallium3D code as done
  on Linux. The preliminary interfaces for this decomposition are already in
  place but there are several open questions. Most importantly, the page-fault
  handling of buffer objects mapped in the application's address space.

  Second, we'd like to complement our current Intel GMA GPU driver with
  interrupt-based synchronization, namely vblank handling. This requires an
  understanding of the Intel GMA interrupt code and the enhancement of our
  driver environment.

  Third, we desire the use of further Gallium3D drivers, in particular the
  Nouveau and r300 drivers. The basic approach to bring these drivers to Genode
  is the same as for Intel GMA but the respective driver environments are yet
  to be developed.

  If you are interested in low-level graphics hacking, GPUs, and
  high-performance graphics, this project is ideal to get you on track.

:Split USB core from USB device drivers:

  Genode's current USB support is based on the Linux USB stack running as a
  single process on Genode. This process includes the USB core logic, USB host
  controller driver as well as the USB device drivers such as HID or USB
  storage. This monolithic USB process is rather inflexible. Hence, we desire a
  decomposition of this solution such that the USB host driver and each USB
  device driver runs in a separate process.

:IOMMU support on the NOVA Hypervisor:

  The NOVA hypervisor is the first open-source microkernel with thorough
  support for IOMMUs, which principally enables the use of untrusted device
  drivers alongside sensitive software on one machine. Without an IOMMU, each
  device driver for a device that operates with DMA, is able to indirectly
  access the whole physical memory through programming the device. With IOMMU,
  the physical memory addressable by DMA operations can be restrained per
  device. The goal of this challenge is to enhance Genode with I/O protection
  when running on the NOVA kernel. This would clear the way towards reusing
  complex untrusted device drivers running in dedicated device-driver OS
  instances.

:I/O Kit:

  I/O Kit is the device-driver framework as used by the Darwin operating
  system, which forms the basis for Mac OS X. The port of I/O Kit would enable
  the easy re-use of the library of I/O-Kit-based device drivers on Genode. As
  foundation of this project, we recommend to use the DDE Kit API featured by
  Genode.

:Support for multi-touch input devices:

  The efforts towards enabling mobile application stacks such as Meego and
  Android on Genode must be accompanied by a revision of Genode's 'Input'
  session interface to accommodate multi-touch input devices. First, existing
  APIs such as multi-touch support in X11, Qt4, and Android should be analysed.
  Based on these findings, we expect a proposal for changing Genode's input
  interface. The interface extension should be validated by a example driver
  implementing the interface as well as an example applications.


System services
###############

:Copy-on-write memory manager:

  Genode's managed dataspaces provide a generalized page-table concept,
  enabling servers to provide on-demand paged memory objects (dataspaces) to
  clients. This concept is showcased by the ISO9660 driver, which provides
  on-demand paged ROM dataspaces to its clients. Depending on the access
  pattern of the client, the ISO9660 server loads the used parts of the ROM
  file from CDROM. Managed dataspaces principally allow for a wide variety of
  interesting applications such as the transparent migration of non-local and
  local memory in a NUMA system, sparse dataspaces, swapping, and copy-on-write
  dataspaces. The goal of this project is a dataspace manager that implements
  copy-on-write semantics combined with a merging technique optimizing the
  memory footprint at runtime. Pages of two managed dataspaces that share the
  same content should be provided via read-only page sharing. If one client
  attempts to change the content of a shared page, a new physical copy of the
  page get created. Vice versa, if the content of different pages converge, the
  sharing should be re-established. This work is a follow-up of the diploma
  thesis of Sebastian Sumpf
  [http://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/papers_ps/sumpf-diplom.pdf - Cloning L4Linux].
  On the course of this project, the managed dataspace concept of Genode
  will be refined, in particular regarding the creation of read-only
  dataspaces from read-write dataspaces.

:Using Haskell as systems-development language:

  The goal of this project is the application of functional programming
  i.e., Haskell, for the implementation of low-level Genode components.
  Implementing critical functionalities in such a high-level language instead
  of a classical systems language such as C or C++ would pave the way towards
  analyzing such components with formal methods.

  The use of Haskell for systems development was pioneered by the
  [http://programatica.cs.pdx.edu/House/ - House Project]. A more recent
  development is [http://halvm.org - HalVM] - a light-weight OS runtime for
  Xen that is based on Haskell.

:Dbus emulation:

  Dbus is a popular inter-process communication mechanism on Linux, which
  enables user applications to respond to global system events and announce
  state changes to other applications. It is extensively used by modern desktop
  environments. To enable such applications to integrate well with Genode, a
  Dbus emulation solution has to be developed.

:Wayland:

  With the availability of Gallium3D on Genode, the prospect for incorporating
  further projects of the Linux graphics ecosystem into Genode arises.
  [http://wayland.freedesktop.org - Wayland] is a window server especially
  designed to be used with Gallium3D. Its design has many similarities with
  Genode's Nitpicker GUI server, in particular the decision to move window
  handling policies to the client and thereby minimize the complexity of the
  GUI server. Whereas Nitpicker was designed for high security, Wayland is
  targeted to creating GUIs with fluid and tearless animations using
  hardware-accelerated graphics. We believe that because of the many conceptual
  parallels with Nitpicker, Wayland would fit very well into the Genode system.
  However, as a prerequisite for this project, Genode's Gallium3D support must
  be decomposed first. See the challenges regarding our Gallium3D support for
  further information.


Runtime environments
####################

:Android's Dalvik VM natively on Genode:

  Dalvik is a Java virtual machine that is used for executing applications on
  Android. By running Dalvik directly on Genode, the Linux kernel could be
  removed from the trusted computing base of Android, facilitating the use of
  this mobile OS in high-assurance settings.

:Vancouver VMM for Genode on the NOVA hypervisor:

  Vancouver is the user-level virtual-machine monitor accompanying the NOVA
  hypervisor. It combines a VT-based CPU virtualization with a rich set of
  device models to run unmodified guest operating systems at near-native
  performance. Since NOVA is a supported base platform of Genode, running
  Vancouver in the dynamic Genode environment has become feasible. By running
  Vancouver on Genode instead of NOVA's original static userland would open up
  new use cases where the combination of faithful virtualization with dynamic
  applications is desired.

  Genode 11.11 introduced the initial integration of Vancouver into Genode.
  This version of Vancouver is able to bootstrap another kernel (e.g.,
  Fiasco.OC) within the virtual machine. However, several pieces are missing
  for reaching the goal of running a fully-fledged Linux OS as guest.

:Runtime for the D programming language:

  The D systems programming language was designed to overcome many gripes that
  exists with C++. In particular, it introduces a sane syntax for meta
  programming, supports unit tests, and contract-based programming. These
  features make D a compelling language to explore when implementing OS
  components. Even though D is a compiled language, it comes with a runtime
  providing support for exception handling and garbage collection. The goal of
  the project is to explore the use of D for Genode programs, porting the
  runtime to Genode, adapting the Genode build system to accommodate D
  programs, and interfacing D programs with other Genode components written in
  C++.


Platforms
#########

:Evaluation of MP scheduling models on different Genode base platforms:

  Several of Genode's supported base platforms come with multi-processor
  support, i.e., Linux, NOVA, L4ka::Pistachio, Codezero, and Fiasco.OC. Each of
  these kernels follows a different approach for utilizing multiple CPUs. For
  example, Linux and Codezero manage the association of threads with CPUs
  largely transparent for user-level programs. In contrast, NOVA makes the use
  of multiple CPUs explicit and constraints the modes of IPC interaction of
  threads running on different CPUs. Furthermore, kernels differ with regard to
  thread migration and scheduling. The goal of this project is to identify ways
  to support the SMP features of the respective kernels at Genode's API level
  such that SMP can be easily utilized by Genode programs in a largely kernel
  agnostic way.

:Microkernelizing Linux:

  Thanks to Genode's generic interfaces for I/O access as provided by core, all
  Genode device drivers including drivers ported from Linux and gPXE can be
  executed as user-level components on all supported microkernels. However, so
  far, we have not enabled the use of these device drivers on Linux as base
  platform. The goal of this project is the systematic replacement of in-kernel
  Linux device drivers by Genode processes running in user space, effectively
  reducing the Linux kernel to a runtime for Genode's core process. But moving
  drivers to Genode processes is just the beginning. By employing further
  Genode functionality such as its native GUI, lwIP, and Noux, many protocol
  stacks can effectively be removed from the Linux kernel.

  The goal of this project is to evaluate how small the Linux kernel can get
  when used as a microkernel.

:Support for the HelenOS/SPARTAN kernel:

  [http://www.helenos.org - HelenOS] is a microkernel-based multi-server OS
  developed at the university of Prague. It is based on the SPARTAN microkernel,
  which runs on a wide variety of CPU architectures including Sparc, MIPS, and
  PowerPC. This broad platform support makes SPARTAN an interesting kernel to
  look at alone. But a further motivation is the fact that SPARTAN does not
  follow the classical L4 road, providing a kernel API that comes with an own
  terminology and different kernel primitives. This makes the mapping of
  SPARTAN's kernel API to Genode a challenging endeavour and would provide us
  with feedback regarding the universality of Genode's internal interfaces.
  Finally, this project has the potential to ignite a further collaboration
  between the HelenOS and Genode communities.

:Support for the seL4 kernel:

  The seL4 kernel developed by NICTA and OK-Labs is the first formally verified
  microkernel. It runs on the x86 and ARM architectures and supports the
  execution of a paravirtualized version of Linux on top. Even though seL4 is
  proprietary technology, a free binary release and the specification of the
  kernel API has been published early 2011. Being a capability-based kernel,
  seL4 is in the line of the current-generation L4 kernels alongside NOVA and
  Fiasco.OC. Genode already supports the latter two kernel, which hints at the
  feasibility to support seL4 as well. Currently, the seL4 kernel comes with a
  rather static user land, which is far from utilizing the full potential of
  the kernel with regard to dynamic resource management. By adapting Genode to
  seL4, a rich dynamic application workload would become available to this
  kernel, which could potentially spawn interest in extending the formal
  verification efforts at NICTA to the Genode system executing dynamic
  real-world applications.

:Support for the Barrelfish kernel:

  [http://barrelfish.org - `Barrelfish] is a so-called multi-kernel OS designed
  for heterogeneous multi-processor systems. At its heart, it is a
  microkernel-based multi-server OS. Its kernel provides different mechanisms
  than L4-based kernels. Instead of managing threads in the kernel, there is a
  mechanism for implementing preemptive multi-threading at user level.
  Consequently, inter-process communication does not address threads but
  protection domains. This makes the Barrelfish kernel a very interesting and
  challenging target for running Genode.

:Support for the XNU kernel (Darwin):

  XNU is the kernel used by Darwin and Mac OS X. It is derived from the
  MACH microkernel and extended with a UNIX-like syscall API. Because the
  kernel is used for Mac OS X, it could represent an industry-strength
  base platform for Genode supporting all CPU features as used by Mac OS X.

:Xen as kernel for Genode:
  Using Xen as kernel for Genode would clear the way to remove the
  overly complex Linux OS from the trusted computing base of Xen
  guests OSes.

  Xen is a hypervisor that can host multiple virtual machines on one physical
  machine. For driving physical devices and for virtual-machine management, Xen
  relies on a privileged guest OS called Dom0. Currently, Linux is the
  predominant choice to be used as Dom0, which implicates a trusted computing
  base of millions of lines of code for the other guest OSes.

  Even though Xen was designed as hypervisor, a thorough analysis done by Julian
  Stecklina concludes that Xen qualifies well as a kernel for Genode. For
  example, Julian implemented a version of Genode's IPC framework that utilizes
  Xen's communication mechanisms (event channels and shared memory).

:Linux process containers for supporting Genode`s resource trading:

  Even though the Linux version of Genode is primarily meant as a development
  platform, there exist interesting opportunities to explore when combining
  Genode with Linux, in particular Linux' process containers.
  Linux process containers provide a mechanism to partition physical resources,
  foremost CPU time, between Linux processes. This raises the interesting
  question of whether this mechanism could be used for a proper implementation
  of Genode's resource trading on Linux.
  [http://lwn.net/Articles/236038/ - Process containers introduction...]


Optimizations
#############

:Low-latency audio streaming:

  Genode comes with an audio streaming interface called 'Audio_out' session.
  It is based on a shared-memory packet stream accompanied with asynchronous
  data-flow signals. For real-time audio processing involving chains of Genode
  components, streams of audio data must be carried at low latency, imposing
  constraints to buffer sizes and the modes of operation of the audio mixer and
  audio drivers. The goal of this project is to create a holistic design of the
  whole chain of audio processing, taking thread-scheduling into account. A
  particular challenge is the mixed output of real-time (small buffer, low
  latency) and non-real-time (larger buffer to compensate jitter, higher
  latency) audio sources.

:De-privileging the VESA graphics driver:

  The VESA graphics driver executes the graphics initialization code provided
  by the graphics card via an x86 emulator. To initialize a graphics mode, this
  code needs to access device hardware. Currently, we permit access to all
  device registers requested by the graphics-card's code. These devices include
  the system timer, the PCI configuration registers, and the interrupt
  controller, which are critical for the proper operating of the kernel. The
  goal of this work is to restrict the permissions of the VESA driver to a
  minimum by virtualizing all devices but the actual graphics card.
