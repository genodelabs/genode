Abstract
########

Genode comes with a growing number of components apparently scattered across
various repositories. This document provides an overview of these components
and outlines the systematics behind them.


Categorization of components
############################

Genode components usually fall into one of four categories, namely device
drivers, resource multiplexers, protocol stacks, and applications. Each
of them is briefly characterized as follows:

:Device drivers: translate hardware resources into device-independent
  session interfaces. Naturally, a device driver is specific to a
  particular hardware platform. The hardware resources are accessed
  via core's IO_MEM, IO_PORT, and IRQ services. The functionality of
  the driver is made available to other system components by announcing
  one of Genode's device-independent session interfaces, which are
  'platform_session', 'framebuffer_session', 'input_session', 'block_session',
  'audio_out_session', 'log_session', 'nic_session', and 'timer_session'
  (see 'os/include/' for the interface definitions). Those interfaces are
  uniform across hardware platforms and kernel base platforms. Usually,
  each device driver can accommodate only one client at a time.

:Resource multiplexers: provide mechanisms to multiplex device resources
  to multiple clients. A typical resource multiplexer requests one
  of Genode's device-independent session interface (usually connected
  to a device driver) and, in turn, announces a service of the same kind.
  However, in contrast to a device driver, a resource multiplexer is able
  to serve more than one client at the same time.

:Protocol stacks: translate low-level interfaces to higher-level
  interfaces (or sometimes vice versa). Typically, a protocol stack comes
  in the form of a library, which uses a device-independent session
  interface as back end and provides a high-level library interface as
  front end. However, protocol stacks also exist in the form of
  distinct components that implement translations between different
  session interfaces.

:Applications: implement functionality using APIs as provided by
  protocol stacks.

:Runtime environments: enable existing 3rd-party software to be executed
  as a Genode sub systems.


Device drivers
##############

Device drivers usually reside in the 'src/drivers' subdirectory of source-code
repositories. The most predominant repositories hosting device drivers are
'os', 'dde_ipxe', 'dde_linux'.


Platform devices
================

:'os/src/drivers/platform/': Platform drivers for various platforms.
  On x86, the platform driver uses the PCI controller as found on x86 PC
  hardware. A client can probe for a particular device and request information
  about physical device resources (using the 'platform_device' interface). I/O
  resources for MMIO regions, I/O ports, and interrupts can be requested by the
  provided device abstraction.

:'os/src/drivers/acpi':
  On x86 platforms that use the APIC (namely Fiasco.OC, NOVA, and hw_x86_64)
  this simple ACPI parser traverses the ACPI tables and reports device-resource
  information (e.g., interrupt lines of PCI devices).

:'libports/src/app/acpica':
  In addition to our ACPI base driver, the acpica component uses the
  ACPICA library to provide access to dynamic functions like battery
  states, events (e.g., notebook lid close and power buttons), as well
  as reset and power off. The componenten reports ACPI events and
  states as reports and itself responds to system state changes of
  certain configuration ROMs.


UART devices
============

The UART device drivers implement the UART-session interface.

:'os/src/drivers/uart/spec/pl011':
  Driver for the PL011 UART as found on many ARM-based platforms.

  Driver for the UART as found on Exynos-5-based hardware.


Framebuffer and input drivers
=============================

Framebuffer and input drivers implement the framebuffer-session interface and
input-session interfaces respectively.

:'os/src/drivers/input/dummy':
  Pseudo input driver without accessing any hardware. This component is useful
  to resolve a dependency from an input session for scenarios where no user
  input is required.

:'os/src/drivers/input/spec/ps2/x86':
  Driver for the 'i8042' PS/2 controller as found in x86 PCs. It supports both
  mouse (including ImPS/2, ExPS/2) and keyboard.

:'os/src/drivers/input/spec/ps2/pl050':
  Driver for the PL050 PS/2 controller as found on ARM platforms such as
  VersatilePB. The physical base address used by the driver is obtained at
  compile time from a header file called 'pl050_defs.h'. The version of the
  VersatilePB platform can be found at 'os/include/platform/vpb926/' and
  is made available to the driver via the SPECS machinery of the Genode build
  system.

interface. Technically, it is both a device driver (accessing a timer
device) and a resource multiplexer (supporting multiple timer-session clients
at the same time). Depending on the base platform, the implementation uses
different time sources. Time sources are either hardware timers, a time source
provided by the kernel, or a pseudo time source (busy):

Resource multiplexers
#####################

By convention, resource multiplexers are located at the 'src/server'
subdirectory of a source repository.

:Framebuffer and input: The framebuffer and input session interfaces can be
  multiplexed using the Nitpicker GUI server, which allows multiple clients to
  create and manage rectangular areas on screen. Nitpicker uses one input
  session and one framebuffer session as back end and, in turn, provides
  so-called nitpicker sessions to one or multiple clients. Each nitpicker
  session contains a virtual framebuffer and a virtual input session. Nitpicker
  (including a README file) is located at 'os/src/server/nitpicker'.

:Audio output: The audio mixer located at 'os/src/server/mixer' enables
  multiple clients to use the audio-out interface. The mixing is done by simply
  adding and clamping the signals of all present clients.

:Networking: The NIC bridge located at 'os/src/server/nic_bridge' multiplexes
  one NIC session to multiple virtual NIC sessions using a proxy-ARP
  implementation. Each client has to obtain a dedicated IP address visible to
  the physical network. DHCP requests originating from the virtual NIC sessions
  are delegated to the physical network.

:Block: The block-device partition server at 'os/src/server/part_blk' reads
  the partition table of a block session and exports each partition found as
  separate block session. For using this server, please refer to the run
  script at 'os/run/part_blk'.

:File system: The FAT file-system service allows multiple clients to
  concurrently access the same FAT-formatted block device. It is located
  at 'libports/src/server/fatfs_fs' and supports FAT, FAT32, and exFAT.

:Terminal: The terminal_mux service located at gems/src/server/terminal_mux
  is able to provide multiple terminal sessions over one terminal-client
  session. The user can switch between the different sessions using a keyboard
  shortcut, which brings up an ncurses-based menu.


Protocol stacks
###############

Protocol stacks come either in the form of separate components that translate
one session interface to another, or in the form of libraries.

Separate components:

:'os/src/server/nit_fb':
  Translates a nitpicker session to a pair of framebuffer and input sessions.
  Each 'nit_fb' instance is visible as a rectangular area on screen presenting
  a virtual frame buffer. The area is statically positioned. For more
  information, please refer to 'os/src/server/nit_fb/README'.

:'gems/src/server/wm':
  Window manager that implements the nitpicker session interface but manages
  each client view as a separate window. The window decorations are provided
  by a so-called decorator (e.g., 'gems/src/app/decorator'). The behaviour
  is defined by a so-called window layouter such as the floating window
  layouter located at 'gems/src/app/floating_window_layouter/'.
