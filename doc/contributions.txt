                          Contributing to Genode
                          ======================


You can contribute to the development of Genode in many different ways. First,
you can contribute by trying out the framework and sharing your expectations
and experience with us. This will help us to adjust the goals of the project
according to the needs of its users. Please do not hesitate to discuss your
ideas or suggestion at our mailing list. Maybe you stumbled over an issue that
should be documented but isn't? Or the documentation contains errors with
regard to content or spelling? Please let us know by raising the issue at the
genode-main mailing list:

:[https://genode.org/community/mailing-lists - Genode mailing lists]:

If you are interested in getting your hands dirty with working on the Genode
code base or authoring additional documentation, you are more than welcome.
For getting a rough overview of the current topics the Genode developers are
pondering over, please have a look at the issue tracker:

:[https://github.com/genodelabs/genode/issues - Issue tracker]:

You will see that the issues cover a large spectre ranging from minor fixes,
over new features, to architectural changes. To pick the topic that suits
you best, please consider introducing your intentions to the mailing list.
We will gladly assist you with picking a topic to get you started.

Alternatively, you may like to have a look at our road map and future
challenges to see the big picture of our developments and to get inspiration
for your own activities:

:[https://genode.org/about/road-map]: Road Map

:[https://genode.org/about/challenges]: Future Challenges

Once you settled on a specific topic to work on, it is a good idea to get
acquainted with the work flow and tools used by the project. The following
sections are meant as a rough guide for working with Genode's mainline source
tree in practice.


Clone the repository
####################

The complete source code for both the Genode OS Framework and its documentation
is managed via the project's public Git repository:

:[https://github.com/genodelabs - Genode Repository at GitHub]:

Also, most of the content of the genode.org website can be found in the form
of plain text file within the repository.

If you intend to contribute changes to the mainline development, we
recommend you to fork the Genode repository on GitHub. This will make it
easy for everyone to track your activities, comment on your work.


Create a topic branch
#####################

As a rule of thumb, every line of development should have a corresponding
issue in the issue tracker. This will be the place where we will discuss
your ongoing work. If there is no issue for your topic, please
create one. Once there exists the issue with a short description about
what your line of work is about, create a new topic branch based on the
'genodelabs/master' branch. For example,

! git checkout -b issue76

Work on your branch in the way you prefer. A long-winded history on your branch
is not a problem because it will stay local to your repository. However, if you
invest your time in maintaining a clean history, this is much appreciated.


Follow Genode's coding conventions
##################################

Genode's source code follows certain time-tested conventions regarding the
coding style and code pattern, which are important to us. The coding style
is described in the following document:

:[https://genode.org/documentation/developer-resources/coding_style]:
  Coding Style Guidelines

We know from experience that for new developers, adhering the coding style can
be distracting and even annoying at times. To relieve you from keeping all
those rules in your head, there is a tool for checking your code against the
guidelines. The *beautify tool* is located at 'tool/beautify'. When invoked
with no arguments, it will provide you with brief usage instructions.


Writing a commit message
########################

* Use the first line to summarize your commit using not more than 50 characters.
  This line will be displayed by various tools. So it should express the basic
  topic and eventually refer to an issue. For example:
  ! Add sanity checks in 'tool/tool_chain', fix #62

* If the patch refers to an existing issue, add a reference to the
  corresponding issue. If not, please consider opening an issue first. In the
  case the patch is supposed to close an existing issue, add this information
  using GitHub's conventions, e.g., by stating "fix #45" in your commit
  message, the issue will be closed automatically, by stating "ref #45', the
  commit will be displayed in the stream of discussion of the corresponding
  issue.

* After a blank line, add a description of the patch. For writing the
  description, keep the following questions in mind:
  * Why is the patch needed?
  * How does the patch achieve the goal?
  * What are known consequences of this patch? Will it break API compatibility,
    or produce a follow-up issue?

  The description should use a line with of about 75 characters. It may consist
  of multiple paragraphs separated by blank lines.

* Proof-read your commit message for spelling or grammatical errors.

* Reconsider the documentation related to your patch: If the commit message
  contains important information not present in the form of source-code
  comments, this information should better placed into the code or the
  accompanied documentation (e.g., in the form of a README file).


Genode Contributors Agreement
#############################

Before we will be able to incorporate your changes into Genode's mainline
development, we require your permission to use your code.

Genode is publicly licensed under the terms of the GNU AGPLv3 with Genode Labs
maintaining the right to also distribute derivates under different licenses or
update the public License.
Contributions from outside Genode Labs can only be incorporated into Genode's
mainline development if each individual contributor explicitly grants the
permission to let Genode Labs redistribute his contributions under non-AGPLv3
licenses. This permission is granted by signing the Genode Contributors
Agreement:

:[http:gca.pdf - Genode Contributor's Agreement]:
  Genode Contributor's Agreement (GCA)

By signing the GCA, you don't lose any rights for your contribution. However,
you enable Genode Labs to license Genode (including your contributions) under
licenses other than the AGPLv3. The GCA needs to be signed only once. The signed
GCA covers your future contributions. Of course, you may cancel this agreement
at your will. Please make sure that you are in the legal position to sign
the GCA (i.e., by making sure that your contribution to Genode is in line with
the Open-Source policy of your employer).

Send a signed copy of the GCA to Genode Labs. The postal address
is *Genode Labs GmbH, Dammweg 2, D-01097 Dresden, Germany*.

Alternatively, you may send a scanned copy of the signed GCA via email
to *licensing@genode-labs.com*.


Incorporating your work into the mainline source tree
#####################################################

Our goal with the 'genodelabs/master' branch is to keep the history as linear
as possible to make it easy for users of the framework to track the
development.
To help us with accomplishing this goal, please make sure that your patch
applies cleanly to 'genodelabs/master'.

For the continuous work on your private topic branch, please feel free to
commit as you like. For example, your commit sequence could look like:

! "Implemented A"
! "Discarded a part of A because it was a bad idea"
! "Fixed spelling in comment"

If your history contains intermediate steps that are not meaningful to have in
'genodelabs/master', you may decide to clean up your history via 'git rebase -i'.
Ideally, each revision should represent a consistent state of your work that
should (at least) build without errors. The refined history will then end up in
the form of just a few commits. For the example above, all three commits should
be merged into a single commit "Feature A" as the intermediate (and potentially
bugged) revisions are not useful to have in 'genodelabs/main'.


Important notice
################

Please do not take the steps described herein too seriously. They are not
carved in stone. If you have suggestions for improving them, or if you feel
staggered by all those rules, please let us know.
