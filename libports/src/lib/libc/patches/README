Manual modifications
####################

:'src/lib/include/rpcsvc/nis.x':

  CPP seems not to be able to parse splitted lines and so fails with
  'definition keyword expected' otherwise (though that's just a rough guess).

:'src/lib/libc/stdlib/malloc.c':

  Undefine 'MALLOC_DSS' to avoid the usage of sbrk.
  ! //#define	MALLOC_DSS

:'src/lib/libc/stdio/vfwprintf.c':

  Fix warnings caused by conversions between (char *) and (wchar_t *).
  This is just a cosmetic fix.

:'src/lib/libc/gen/_pthread_stubs.c':

  Prevent definition of symbol 'pthread_cancel'. This symbol is provided by the
  C++ support library as weak symbol. By redefining this symbol as non-weak in
  the libc, the C++ support library would use the libc dummy stub instead its
  own implementation, causing problems with handling exceptions.

:'src/lib/libc/resolv/res_send.c':

  Disable usage of kqueue and fix building libresolv when kqueue is disabled.
