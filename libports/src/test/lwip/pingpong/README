Pingpong is a simple test where a client sends ping packets with different
sizes to a server. The client has to specify the serverip in its config
as well as the start and end of the ping packet sizes in bytes.

! <start name="test-ping_client">
! 	<resource name="RAM" quantum="16M"/>
! 	<config>
! 		<argv verbose="1" serverip="x.x.x.x" startsize="256" endsize="32768" />
! 	</config>
! </start>

If verbose is set 1 the client and the server will print the id and the
size of each packet (packet header + payload size).
