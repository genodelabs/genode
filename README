                      Genode Operating System Framework
                      =================================


This is the source tree of the reference implementation of the Genode OS
architecture. For a general overview about the architecture, please refer to
the project's official website:

  [https://genode.org/documentation/general-overview]

The current implementation can be compiled for 8 different kernels: Linux,
L4ka::Pistachio, L4/Fiasco, OKL4, NOVA, Fiasco.OC, seL4, and a custom
kernel for running Genode directly on ARM-based hardware. Whereas the Linux
version serves us as development vehicle and enables us to rapidly develop the
generic parts of the system, the actual target platforms of the framework are
microkernels. There is no "perfect" microkernel - and neither should there be
one. If a microkernel pretended to be fit for all use cases, it wouldn't be
"micro". Hence, all microkernels differ in terms of their respective features,
complexity, and supported hardware architectures.

Genode allows the use of each of the kernels listed above with a rich set of
device drivers, protocol stacks, libraries, and applications in a uniform way.
For developers, the framework provides an easy way to target multiple different
kernels instead of tying the development to a particular kernel technology. For
kernel developers, Genode contributes advanced workloads, stress-testing their
kernel, and enabling a variety of application use cases that would not be
possible otherwise. For users and system integrators, it enables the choice of
the kernel that fits best with the requirements at hand for the particular
usage scenario.
