This directory contains boot-loader files needed to boot Genode and to create
boot images. The tools are available in binary form. Pointers to the source
code respectively the download source of binaries are described below.

:'bender', 'microcode'

  The tools are part of the 'morbo' toolchain available under GPL.
  The toolchain was obtained from https://github.com/TUD-OS/morbo.
  For Genode bender was modified so that binaries are only relocated up
  to 2G physical. Additional, relocation can be limited to 256M for sel4.
  The microcode tools expect to find a module named micro.code which contains
  a valid Intel microcode file for the target CPU.

  The changes are available from
  https://github.com/alex-ab/morbo.git.

:'unzip'

  The 'unzip' tool is part of the 'morbo' toolchain available under GPL.
  The toolchain was obtained from https://github.com/TUD-OS/morbo.
  For Genode the unzip was modified so that raw binary images with a Multiboot
  OS header can be loaded.
