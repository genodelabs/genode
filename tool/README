This directory contains tools for managing and using the source code
of Genode.

:'create_builddir'

  The 'create_builddir' tool provides a convenient way to create build
  directories for different platforms. Its usage information is printed when
  starting the tool without arguments.

:'builddir/':

  This directory contains a Makefile template and configuration snippets used
  by the 'create_builddir' tool.

:'tool_chain':

  This tool downloads, builds, and installs the tool chain needed to build the
  Genode OS Framework. For getting usage information, start the tool without
  arguments.

:'create_iso':

  This simple tool helps to build bootable ISO images from your build of
  Genode. For getting usage information, start the tool without arguments.

:'create_grub2':

  This tool prepares a partitioned disk image with GRUB2 as boot
  loader.

:'grub2-head.img':

  This file is the head part of a partioned disk image including an
  installation of GRUB2 as boot loader. GRUB2 is available from
  http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/ and in major Linux distributions.
  Steps to reproduce the image creation can be found in
  'create_grub2'.

:'beautify':

  Beautify is a coding-style checking tool that analyzes source code for its
  adherence to Genode's coding style as described in 'doc/coding_style.txt'.
  Whenever possible, the tool tries to fix the issues and outputs a corrected
  file.  Some corrections, however, require human interaction.  In this case,
  the tool stops the analysis with an error.

:'parse_cxx':

  This tool is a C++ parser used as front-end for Beautify.

:'cxx_to_html':

  This tool converts a C++ source file to a HTML view to be used for the API
  documentation at the genode.org website. It relies on 'parse_cxx' to do the
  actual C++ parsing.

:'fix_include_ifndef':

  This tool helps with assigning consistent include guards to header files.

:'boot':

  This directory contains boot-loader files needed to create boot images.

:'autopilot':

  Autopilot is a tool for the automatic execution of run scripts among multiple
  base platforms.

:'abi_symbols':

  The utility assists with the initial creation of a ABI-symbols file, taking
  a shared object as a starting point. For more information, refer to the
  header of the 'abi_symbols' script.

:'check_abi':

  The 'check_abi' helper is used by the build system to detect violations of
  an ABI by a shared library. Most importantly, it reports incompatibilities of
  symbol sizes, which require an adaptation of the ABI. For more information,
  refer to the header of the 'check_abi' script.
