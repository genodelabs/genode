	# the input for conversion to UTF-8. In the case of the serial connection,
	# this may not be valid with garbage bytes in the character stream. If any
	# garbage coming from the serial connection is interpreted as the beginning
	# of a UTF-8 multi-byte sequence but does not resemble the complete
	# sequence (i.e., is truncated), parsing may result in EOF. To prevent this
	# from happening one may use a filter that sanitizes the serial output,
